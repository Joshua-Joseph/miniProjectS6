An "environment" in Python is the context in which a Python program runs and consists of an interpreter and any number of installed packages. After you finish this article, you'll have a good understanding of:   General environment concepts  How to select an environment  How to create a virtual or conda environment  How to select and activate a virtual environment  How to work with Environments and Terminal windows  Where the Python extension looks for environments  Environment variables and environment variable definitions files (.env)   While this article provides some information about Python environments and their concepts, it is primarily for understanding how to work with them within VS Code. If you're new to working with Python environments, you can learn more at Virtual Environments and Packages (Python.org) and Installing Python Modules (Python.org) .   Note : If you're looking to get started with Python in Visual Studio Code, refer to the tutorial Getting Started with Python in VS Code . The Python tutorial (Python.org) might also be helpful if you're new to the Python language.   Global and virtual environments  By default, any Python interpreter that you've installed runs in its own global environment , which is not specific to any one project. For example, if you just run python (Windows) or python3 (macOS/Linux) at a new command prompt, you're running in that interpreter's global environment. Accordingly, any packages that you install or uninstall affect the global environment and all programs that you run within that context.  Although working in the global environment is an easy way to get started, that environment will, over time, become cluttered with many different packages that you've installed for different projects. Such clutter makes it difficult to thoroughly test an application against a specific set of packages with known versions, which is exactly the kind of environment you'd set up on a build server or web server.  For this reason, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. When you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you then run a Python program within that environment, you know that it's running against only those specific packages. Be aware that if you're not using a virtual environment , and you have multiple versions of Python installed and set in the path environment variable, you might need to specify the Python interpreter to use in the terminal for installing packages to the global environment.   Note : While it's possible to open a virtual environment folder as a workspace, doing so is not recommended and might cause issues with using the Python extension.   Conda environments  A conda environment is a Python environment that's managed using the conda package manager (see Getting started with conda (conda.io)). Conda works well to create environments with interrelated dependencies as well as binary packages. Unlike virtual environments, which are scoped to a project, conda environments are available globally on any given computer. This availability makes it easy to configure several distinct conda environments and then choose the appropriate one for any given project.  Where the extension looks for environments  The extension automatically looks for interpreters in the following locations:   Standard install paths such as /usr/local/bin , /usr/sbin , /sbin , c:\\python27 , c:\\python36 , etc.  Virtual environments located directly under the workspace (project) folder.  Virtual environments located in the folder identified by the python.venvPath setting (see General settings ), which can contain multiple virtual environments. The extension looks for virtual environments in the first-level subfolders of venvPath .  Virtual environments located in a ~/.virtualenvs folder for virtualenvwrapper .  Interpreters installed by pyenv , Pipenv , and Poetry .  Virtual environments located in the path identified by WORKON_HOME (as used by virtualenvwrapper ).  Conda environments that contain a Python interpreter. VS Code does not show conda environments that don't contain an interpreter.  Interpreters installed in a .direnv folder for direnv under the workspace (project) folder.   You can also manually specify an interpreter if Visual Studio Code does not locate it automatically.   Note : Once the "select interpreter" flow is triggered, pipenv environments for the workspace folder will be searched for. If one is found, then no other interpreters are searched for or listed as pipenv expects to manage all aspects.   The extension also loads an environment variable definitions file identified by the python.envFile setting. The default value of this setting is ${workspaceFolder}/.env .  Work with environments  Create a virtual environment  To create a virtual environment, use the following command, where ".venv" is the name of the environment folder:  # macOS/Linux  # You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first  python3 -m venv .venv  # Windows  # You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv  python -m venv .venv   Note : To learn more about the venv module, see Creation of virtual environments on Python.org.   When you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed to allow you to select it for the workspace.   This will add the path to the Python interpreter from the new virtual environment to your workspace settings. That environment will then be used when installing packages and running code through the Python extension. For examples of using virtual environment in projects, see the Python , Django , and Flask tutorials.   Tip : When you're ready to deploy the application to other computers, you can create a requirements.txt file with the command pip freeze > requirements.txt ( pip3 on macOS/Linux). The requirements file describes the packages you've installed in your virtual environment. With only this file, you or other developers can restore those packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (or, again, pip3 on macOS/Linux). By using a requirements file, you need not commit the virtual environment itself to source control.   Create a conda environment  The Python extension automatically detects existing conda environments provided that the environment contains a Python interpreter. For example, the following command creates a conda environment with the Python 3.4 interpreter and several libraries, which VS Code then shows in the list of available interpreters:  conda create -n env-01 python=3.4 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel  In contrast, if you fail to specify an interpreter, as with conda create --name env-00 , the environment won't appear in the list.  For more information on the conda command line, see Conda environments (conda.io).  Additional notes:    If you create a new conda environment while VS Code is running, use the Reload Window command to refresh the environment list shown with Python: Select Interpreter ; otherwise you may not see the environment there. It might take a short time to appear; if you don't see it at first, wait 15 seconds then try using the command again.    To ensure the environment is set up well from a shell perspective, one option is to use an Anaconda prompt with the activated environment to launch VS Code using the code . command. At that point you just need to select the interpreter using the Command Palette or by clicking on the status bar.    Although the Python extension for VS Code doesn't currently have direct integration with conda environment.yml files, VS Code itself is a great YAML editor.    Conda environments can't be automatically activated in the VS Code Integrated Terminal if the default shell is set to PowerShell. To change the shell, see Integrated terminal - Configuration .    You can manually specify the path to the conda executable to use for activation (version 4.4+). To do so, open the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings . Then set python.condaPath , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate path.    Select and activate an environment  By default, the Python extension looks for and uses the first Python interpreter it finds in the system path. To select a specific environment, use the Python: Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ).    Note : If the Python extension doesn't find an interpreter, it issues a warning. On macOS, the extension also issues a warning if you're using the OS-installed Python interpreter, because you typically want to use an interpreter you install directly. In either case, you can disable these warnings by setting python.disableInstallationCheck to true in your user settings .   You can switch environments at any time; switching environments helps you test different parts of your project with different interpreters or library versions as needed.  The Python: Select Interpreter command displays a list of available global environments, conda environments, and virtual environments. (See the Where the extension looks for environments section for details, including the distinctions between these types of environments.) The following image, for example, shows several Anaconda and CPython installations along with a conda environment and a virtual environment ( env ) that's located within the workspace folder:    Note: On Windows, it can take a little time for VS Code to detect available conda environments. During that process, you may see "(cached)" before the path to an environment. The label indicates that VS Code is presently working with cached information for that environment.   If you have a folder or a workspace open in VS Code and you select an interpreter from the list, the Python extension will store that information internally so that the same interpreter will be used once you reopen the workspace.  The Python extension uses the selected environment for running Python code (using the Python: Run Python File in Terminal command), providing language services (auto-complete, syntax checking, linting, formatting, etc.) when you have a .py file open in the editor, and opening a terminal with the Terminal: Create New Terminal command. In the latter case, VS Code automatically activated the selected environment.   Tip : To prevent automatic activation of a selected environment, add "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false to your settings.json file (it can be placed anywhere as a sibling to the existing settings).    Tip : If the activate command generates the message "Activate.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the
current system.", then you need to temporarily change the PowerShell execution policy to allow scripts to
run (see About Execution Policies in the PowerShell documentation): Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process    Note : By default, VS Code uses the interpreter selected for your workspace when debugging code. You can override this behavior by specifying a different path in the python property of a debug configuration. See Choose a debugging environment .   The Status Bar always shows the current interpreter.   The Status Bar also reflects when no interpreter is selected.   In either case, clicking this area of the Status Bar is a convenient shortcut for the Python: Select Interpreter command.   Tip : If you have any problems with VS Code recognizing a virtual environment, please file an issue in the extension repository so we can help determine the cause.   Manually specify an interpreter  If VS Code does not automatically locate an interpreter you want to use, you can browse for the interpreter on your file system or provide the path to it manually.  You can do so by running the Python: Select Interpreter command and clicking on the Enter interpreter path... option that shows on the top of the interpreters list:   You can then either enter the full path of the Python interpreter directly in the text box (for example, ".venv/Scripts/python.exe"), or you can click on the Find... button and browse your file system to find the python executable you wish to select.   If you want to manually specify a default interpreter that will be used once you first open your workspace, you can create or modify an entry for python.defaultInterpreterPath setting in your workspace settings.json with the full path to the Python executable.  For example:    Windows:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "c:/python39/python.exe"  }    macOS/Linux:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "/home/python39/python"  }    You can also use python.defaultInterpreterPath to point to a virtual environment, for example:    Windows:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "c:/dev/ala/venv/Scripts/python.exe"  }    macOS/Linux:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "/home/abc/dev/ala/venv/bin/python"  }     Note : Changes to the python.defaultInterpreterPath setting are not picked up after an interpreter has already been selected for a workspace; any changes to the setting will be ignored once an initial interpreter is selected for the workspace.   Additionally, if you'd like to set up a default interpreter to all of your Python applications, you can add an entry for python.defaultInterpreterPath manually inside your User Settings. To do so, open the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings . Then set python.defaultInterpreterPath , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate interpreter.  You can also use an environment variable in the path setting using the syntax ${env:VARIABLE} . For example, if you've created a variable named PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC with a path to an interpreter, you can then use the following setting value:  "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "${env:PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC}" ,   Note : Variable substitution is only supported in VS Code settings files, it will not work in .env environment files.   By using an environment variable, you can easily transfer a project between operating systems where the paths are different, just be sure to set the environment variable on the operating system first.  Environments and Terminal windows  After using Python: Select Interpreter , that interpreter is applied when right-clicking a file and selecting Python: Run Python File in Terminal . The environment is also activated automatically when you use the Terminal: Create New Terminal command unless you change the python.terminal.activateEnvironment setting to false .  However, launching VS Code from a shell in which a certain Python environment is activated does not automatically activate that environment in the default Integrated Terminal. Use the Terminal: Create New Terminal command after VS Code is running.   Note: conda environments cannot be automatically activated in the integrated terminal if PowerShell is set as the integrated shell. See Integrated terminal - Configuration for how to change the shell.   Any changes you make to an activated environment within the terminal are persistent. For example, using conda install <package> from the terminal with a conda environment activated installs the package into that environment permanently. Similarly, using pip install in a terminal with a virtual environment activated adds the package to that environment.  Changing interpreters with the Python: Select Interpreter command doesn't affect terminal panels that are already open. You can thus activate separate environments in a split terminal: select the first interpreter, create a terminal for it, select a different interpreter, then use the split button ( ⌘\ (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+5 ) ) in the terminal title bar.  Choose a debugging environment  By default, the debugger will use the Python interpreter you have selected with the Python extension. However, if you have a python property in the debug configuration of launch.json , that interpreter is used instead. To be more specific, VS Code will give precedence to the python property of the selected debug configuration in launch.json . If it's not defined, then it will use the path to the Python interpreter you have selected for your workspace.  For more details on debug configuration, see Debugging configurations .  Limited support for Python 2.7  The Python extension no longer offers IntelliSense support for Python 2.7 with Jedi as it only supports Python 3 at this point. When using Python 2.7 with the Python extension you can customize the language server setting to either turn off auto-completions or select Pylance as your language server, as it may provide a good experience if the code is compatible enough with Python 3.  We currently support selecting Python 2.7 as an interpreter in your workspace. Because Python 2.7 is no longer maintained as of January 2020 , we strongly suggest you to upgrade your code to Python 3 as soon as you can. You can learn how to port your code to Python 3 if you need help.  Environment variables  Environment variable definitions file  An environment variable definitions file is a simple text file containing key-value pairs in the form of environment_variable=value , with # used for comments. Multiline values are not supported, but values can refer to any other environment variable that's already defined in the system or earlier in the file. For more information, see Variable substitution . Environment variable definitions files can be used for scenarios such as debugging and tool execution (including linters, formatters, IntelliSense, and testing tools), but are not applied to the terminal.  By default, the Python extension looks for and loads a file named .env in the current workspace folder, then applies those definitions. The file is identified by the default entry "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env" in your user settings (see General settings ). You can change the python.envFile setting at any time to use a different definitions file.  A debug configuration also contains an envFile property that also defaults to the .env file in the current workspace (see Debugging - Set configuration options ). This property allows you to easily set variables for debugging purposes that replace variables specified in the default .env file.  For example, when developing a web application, you might want to easily switch between development and production servers. Instead of coding the different URLs and other settings into your application directly, you could use separate definitions files for each. For example:  dev.env file  # dev.env - development configuration  # API endpoint  MYPROJECT_APIENDPOINT=https://my.domain.com/api/dev/  # Variables for the database  MYPROJECT_DBURL=https://my.domain.com/db/dev  MYPROJECT_DBUSER=devadmin  MYPROJECT_DBPASSWORD=!dfka**213=  prod.env file  # prod.env - production configuration  # API endpoint  MYPROJECT_APIENDPOINT=https://my.domain.com/api/  # Variables for the database  MYPROJECT_DBURL=https://my.domain.com/db/  MYPROJECT_DBUSER=coreuser  MYPROJECT_DBPASSWORD=kKKfa98*11@  You can then set the python.envFile setting to ${workspaceFolder}/prod.env , then set the envFile property in the debug configuration to ${workspaceFolder}/dev.env .   Note : When environment variables are specified using multiple methods, be aware that there is an order of precedence. Environment variables contained in the .env file specified by the python.envFile setting (user or workspace) will override variables defined in the envFile specified in launch.json , as well as any env variables defined in the launch.json file itself. Similarly, environment variables defined in the envFile specified in launch.json will override env variables defined in the launch.json file.   Variable substitution  When defining an environment variable in a definitions file, you can use the value of any existing environment variable with the following general syntax:  <VARIABLE>=... ${env : EXISTING_VARIABLE} ...  where ... means any other text as used in the value. The curly braces are required.  Within this syntax, the following rules apply:   Variables are processed in the order they appear in the .env file, so you can use any variable that's defined earlier in the file.  Single or double quotes don't affect substituted value and are included in the defined value. For example, if the value of VAR1 is abcedfg , then VAR2='${env:VAR1}' assigns the value 'abcedfg' to VAR2 .  The $ character can be escaped with a backslash, as in \$ .  You can use recursive substitution, such as PYTHONPATH=${env:PROJ_DIR}:${env:PYTHONPATH} (where PROJ_DIR is any other environment variable).  You can use only simple substitution; nesting such as ${_${env:VAR1}_EX} is not supported.  Entries with unsupported syntax are left as-is.   Use of the PYTHONPATH variable  The PYTHONPATH environment variable specifies additional locations where the Python interpreter should look for modules. In VS Code, PYTHONPATH can be set through the terminal settings (terminal.integrated.env.*) and/or within an .env file.  When the terminal settings are used, PYTHONPATH affects any tools that are run within the terminal by a user, as well as any action the extension performs for a user that is routed through the terminal such as debugging. However, in this case when the extension is performing an action that isn't routed through the terminal, such as the use of a linter or formatter, then this setting will not have an effect on module look-up.  When PYTHONPATH is set using an .env file, it will affect anything the extension does on your behalf and actions performed by the debugger, but it will not affect tools run in the terminal.  If needed, you can set PYTHONPATH using both methods.  An example of when to use PYTHONPATH would be if you have source code in a src folder and tests in a tests folder. When running tests, however, those tests can't normally access modules in src unless you hard-code relative paths.  To solve this problem, you could add the path to src to PYTHONPATH by creating an .env file within your VS Code workspace.  PYTHONPATH = src  Then set python.envFile in your settings.json file to point to the .env file you just created. For example, if the .env file was in your workspace root, your settings.json would be set as shown:  "python.envFile" : "${workspaceFolder}/.env"  The value of PYTHONPATH can contain multiple locations separated by os.pathsep : a semicolon ( ; ) on Windows and a colon ( : ) on Linux/macOS. Invalid paths are ignored. If you find that your value for PYTHONPATH isn't working as expected, make sure that you're using the correct separator between locations for the operating system. For example, using a colon to separate locations on Windows, or using a semicolon to separate locations on Linux/macOS results in an invalid value for PYTHONPATH, which is ignored.   Note : PYTHONPATH does not specify a path to a Python interpreter itself. For additional information about PYTHONPATH, read the PYTHONPATH documentation .

This page describes the key settings you can work with.  For general information about working with settings in VS Code, refer to User and workspace settings , as well as the Variables reference for information about predefined variable support.  General settings     Setting (python.)  Default  Description      condaPath  "conda"  Path to the conda executable.    defaultInterpreterPath  "python"  Path to the default Python interpreter to be used by the Python extension on the first time it loads for a workspace, or the path to a folder containing the Python interpreter. Can use variables like ${workspaceFolder} and ${workspaceFolder}/.venv . Using a path to a folder allows anyone working with a project to create an environment in the .venv folder as appropriate to their operating system, rather than having to specify an exact platform-dependent path. settings.json file can then be included in a source code repository. Note : Changes to this setting made after an interpreter has been selected for a workspace will not be applied or considered by the Python extension. As well, the Python extension doesn't automatically add or change this setting.    pipenvPath  "pipenv"  Path to the pipenv executable to use for activation.    disableInstallationCheck  false  If set to true , disables a warning from the extension if no Python interpreter is installed. On macOS, also disables a warning that appears if you're using the OS-installed Python interpreter. It's generally recommended to install a separate interpreter on macOS.    venvFolders  []  Paths to folders where virtual environments are created. Depending on the virtualization tool used, it can be the project itself: ${workspaceFolder} , or separate folders for all virtual environments located side by side: .\envs , ~/.virtualenvs , and so on.    envFile  "${workspaceFolder}/ .env"  Absolute path to a file containing environment variable definitions. See Configuring Python environments - environment variable definitions file .    globalModuleInstallation  false  Specifies whether to install packages for the current user only using the --user command-line argument (the default), or to install for all users in the global environment (when set to true ). Ignored when using a virtual environment. For more information on the --user argument, see pip - User Installs .    poetryPath  "poetry"  Specifies the location of the Poetry dependency manager executable, if installed. The default value "poetry" assumes the executable is in the current path. The Python extension uses this setting to install packages when Poetry is available and there's a poetry.lock file in the workspace folder.    terminal.launchArgs  []  Launch arguments that are given to the Python interpreter when you run a file using commands such as Python: Run Python File in Terminal . In the launchArgs list, each item is a top-level command-line element that's separated by a space (quoted values that contain spaces are a single top-level element and are thus one item in the list). For example, for the arguments --a --b --c {"value1" : 1, "value2" : 2} , the list items should be ["--a", "--b", "--c", "{\"value1\" : 1, \"value2\" : 2}\""] . Note that Visual Studio code ignores this setting when debugging because it instead uses arguments from your selected debugging configuration in launch.json .    terminal.executeInFileDir  false  Indicates whether to run a file in the file's directory instead of the current folder.    terminal.activateEnvironment  true  Indicates whether to automatically activate the environment you select using the Python: Select Interpreter command when a new terminal is created. For example, when this setting is true and you select a virtual environment, the extension automatically runs the environment's activate command when creating a new terminal ( source env/bin/activate on macOS/Linux; env\scripts\activate on Windows).    terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal  false  Specifies whether to activate the currently open terminal when the Python extension is activated, using the virtual environment selected.    logging.level  error  Specifies the level of logging to be performed by the extension. The possible levels of logging, in increasing level of information provided, are off , error , warn , info , and debug . When set to off , which is not recommended, basic information will still be shown such as startup information and commands run by the Python extension. At the error level, basic information and errors will be shown. At the warn level, basic, error, and warning information will be shown. At the info level, basic, error, warning, and additional information like method execution times and return values will be shown. At this time, the debug level doesn't display additional information.     Code analysis settings  IntelliSense engine settings   Note: If you have never changed your language server setting, your language server is set to Pylance via the “Default” setting value.      Setting (python.)  Default  Description      languageServer  Default  Defines type of the language server (Default, Pylance , Jedi, and None).     Python Language Server settings  Pylance Language Server  The language server settings apply when python.languageServer is Pylance or Default . If you have difficulties with the language server, see Troubleshooting in the language server repository.     Setting (python.analysis.)  Default  Description      typeCheckingMode  off  Specifies the level of type checking analysis to perform. Available values are off , basic , and strict . When set to off no type checking analysis is conducted; unresolved imports/variables diagnostics are produced. When set to basic non-type checking-related rules (all rules in off ), as well as basic type checking rules are used. When set to strict all type checking rules at the highest severity of error (including all rules in off and basic categories) are used.    diagnosticMode  openFilesOnly  Specifies what code files the language server analyzes for problems. Available values are workspace and openFilesOnly .    stubPath  ./typings  Specifies a path to a directory that contains custom type stubs. Each package's type stub file(s) are expected to be in its own subdirectory.    autoSearchPaths  true  Indicates whether to automatically add search paths based on some predefined names (like src ). Available values are true and false .    extraPaths  []  Specifies extra search paths for import resolution. Paths should be specified as strings and must be separated by commas when there are multiple paths. ["path 1","path 2"]    completeFunctionParens  false  Adds parentheses to function completions. Accepted values are true and false .    useLibraryCodeForTypes  true  Parses the source code for a package when a type stub is not found. Available values are true and false .    autoImportCompletions  true  Controls the offering of auto-imports in completions. Available values are true and false .    diagnosticSeverityOverrides  {}  Allows a user to override the severity levels for individual diagnostics. For each rule, the available severity levels are error (red squiggle), warning (yellow squiggle), information (blue squiggle), and none (rule disabled). For information about the keys to use for the diagnostic severity rules, see the Diagnostic severity rules section below.      Note: Similar to the core Python extension, Pylance has an Insiders program that offers early access to new features and improvements. To enable the Insiders program, set pylance.insidersChannel to daily . This setting enables a daily check for new builds. At startup or when the Insiders setting is changed, Pylance will automatically update and prompt you to reload. To leave the Insiders program, just remove the setting, or explicitly set it to off instead. You might be prompted to downgrade your extension to the latest stable version.   Diagnostic severity rules  This section details all the available rules that can be customized using the python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides setting as shown in the following example.  {   "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides" : {   "reportUnboundVariable" : "information" ,   "reportImplicitStringConcatenation" : "warning"  }  }     Value  Description      reportGeneralTypeIssues  Diagnostics for general type inconsistencies, unsupported operations, argument/parameter mismatches, etc. This covers all of the basic type-checking rules not covered by other rules. It does not include syntax errors.    reportPropertyTypeMismatch  Diagnostics for properties where the type of the value passed to the setter is not assignable to the value returned by the getter. Such mismatches violate the intended use of properties, which are meant to act like variables.    reportPropertyTypeMismatch  Diagnostics for member accesses on functions.    reportMissingImports  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding imported python file or type stub file.    reportMissingModuleSource  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding source file. This happens when a type stub is found, but the module source file was not found, indicating that the code may fail at runtime when using this execution environment. Type checking will be done using the type stub.    reportMissingTypeStubs  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding type stub file (either a typeshed file or a custom type stub). The type checker requires type stubs to do its best job at analysis.    reportImportCycles  Diagnostics for cyclical import chains. These are not errors in Python, but they do slow down type analysis and often hint at architectural layering issues. Generally, they should be avoided.    reportUnusedImport  Diagnostics for an imported symbol that is not referenced within that file.    reportUnusedClass  Diagnostics for a class with a private name (starting with an underscore) that is not accessed.    reportUnusedFunction  Diagnostics for a function or method with a private name (starting with an underscore) that is not accessed.    reportUnusedVariable  Diagnostics for a variable that is not accessed.    reportDuplicateImport  Diagnostics for an imported symbol or module that is imported more than once.    reportWildcardImportFromLibrary  Diagnostics for a wildcard import from an external library.    reportOptionalSubscript  Diagnostics for an attempt to subscript (index) a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalMemberAccess  Diagnostics for an attempt to access a member of a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalCall  Diagnostics for an attempt to call a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalIterable  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as an iterable value (e.g. within a for statement).    reportOptionalContextManager  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as a context manager (as a parameter to a with statement).    reportOptionalOperand  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as an operand to a binary or unary operator (like '+', '==', 'or', 'not').    reportUntypedFunctionDecorator  Diagnostics for function decorators that have no type annotations. These obscure the function type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedClassDecorator  Diagnostics for class decorators that have no type annotations. These obscure the class type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedBaseClass  Diagnostics for base classes whose type cannot be determined statically. These obscure the class type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedNamedTuple  Diagnostics when “namedtuple” is used rather than “NamedTuple”. The former contains no type information, whereas the latter does.    reportPrivateUsage  Diagnostics for incorrect usage of private or protected variables or functions. Protected class members begin with a single underscore _ and can be accessed only by subclasses. Private class members begin with a double underscore but do not end in a double underscore and can be accessed only within the declaring class. Variables and functions declared outside of a class are considered private if their names start with either a single or double underscore, and they cannot be accessed outside of the declaring module.    reportConstantRedefinition  Diagnostics for attempts to redefine variables whose names are all-caps with underscores and numerals.    reportIncompatibleMethodOverride  Diagnostics for methods that override a method of the same name in a base class in an incompatible manner (wrong number of parameters, incompatible parameter types, or incompatible return type).    reportIncompatibleVariableOverride  Diagnostics for class variable declarations that override a symbol of the same name in a base class with a type that is incompatible with the base class symbol type.    reportInvalidStringEscapeSequence  Diagnostics for invalid escape sequences used within string literals. The Python specification indicates that such sequences will generate a syntax error in future versions.    reportUnknownParameterType  Diagnostics for input or return parameters for functions or methods that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownArgumentType  Diagnostics for call arguments for functions or methods that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownLambdaType  Diagnostics for input or return parameters for lambdas that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownVariableType  Diagnostics for variables that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownMemberType  Diagnostics for class or instance variables that have an unknown type.    reportMissingTypeArgument  Diagnostics for when a generic class is used without providing explicit or implicit type arguments.    reportInvalidTypeVarUse  Diagnostics for improper use of type variables in a function signature.    reportCallInDefaultInitializer  Diagnostics for function calls within a default value initialization expression. Such calls can mask expensive operations that are performed at module initialization time.    reportUnnecessaryIsInstance  Diagnostics for 'isinstance' or 'issubclass' calls where the result is statically determined to be always true or always false. Such calls are often indicative of a programming error.    reportUnnecessaryCast  Diagnostics for 'cast' calls that are statically determined to be unnecessary. Such calls are sometimes indicative of a programming error.    reportAssertAlwaysTrue  Diagnostics for 'assert' statement that will probably always assert. This can be indicative of a programming error.    reportSelfClsParameterName  Diagnostics for a missing or misnamed “self” parameter in instance methods and “cls” parameter in class methods. Instance methods in metaclasses (classes that derive from “type”) are allowed to use “cls” for instance methods.    reportImplicitStringConcatenation  Diagnostics for two or more string literals that follow each other, indicating an implicit concatenation. This is considered a bad practice and often masks bugs such as missing commas.    reportUndefinedVariable  Diagnostics for undefined variables.    reportUnboundVariable  Diagnostics for unbound and possibly unbound variables.    reportInvalidStubStatement  Diagnostics for statements that should not appear within a stub file.    reportUnusedCallResult  Diagnostics for call expressions whose results are not consumed and are not None.    reportUnsupportedDunderAll  Diagnostics for unsupported operations performed on __all__ .    reportUnusedCoroutine  Diagnostics for call expressions that return a Coroutine and whose results are not consumed.     Jedi Language Server  The language server settings apply when python.languageServer is Jedi .     Setting  Default  Description      jediPath  ""  Path to folder containing the Jedi library (folder should contain a jedi subfolder).    jediMemoryLimit  0  Memory limit for the Jedi completion engine in megabytes. Zero (the default) means 1024 MB. -1 disables the memory limit check.     AutoComplete settings     Setting (python.autoComplete.)  Default  Description  See also      extraPaths  []  Specifies locations of additional packages for which to load autocomplete data.  Editing     Formatting settings     Setting (python.formatting.)

Visual Code remembers the settings for a project/workspace using the .vscode/settings.json file which is in the root folder of the project.  Once it is set, every time you open that project, vscode will set the right environment  – Athir Nuaimi   Dec 13, 2019 at 12:51               Does this answer your question?

Since the 2021.6.0 (16 June 2021) update we should use  Windows:  {
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "c:/dev/ala/venv/Scripts/python.exe"
}  macOS/Linux:  {
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/abc/dev/ala/venv/bin/python"
}  The vscode documentation has already been updated. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_manually-specify-an-interpreter          Share    Follow          edited Jan 26 at 11:48       Felipe Alvarez   3,444 2 2 gold badges 28 28 silver badges 39 39 bronze badges        answered Jul 21, 2021 at 10:30       krema krema   441 5 5 silver badges 14 14 bronze badges                Add a comment  |                   6               Once you selected an interpreter, it should be stored in the settings.json file in .vscode folder. It should be something like this:  {
  "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe"
}  Next time you use vscode to open this folder, the python interpreter you used last time should be automatically selected.  Maybe you didn't use "Open folder" to open the working directory. And then vscode will try to read the local .vscode folder if any, otherwise it will follow a certain path order to select an interpreter. Hope that helps.

In your case, you wish to set it to /usr/bin/python3.6 . Though I would suggest using a virtual environment .  {  
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/bin/python3.6"
}  If you are using virtual environment, to ensure that the terminal is using the associated python environment , check the second option Python > Terminal: Activate Environment :   In settings.json it is called "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true .  One reason your change did not persist, was because in your screenshot, you opened your workspace's  settings.json .
To make it default, you should edit your user's  settings.json instead.
This you can access with Ctrl+Shift+P , Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) .

It does not work. Whatever the answer is, it is not 'Python: Select Interpreter'. I have Python 3.8 selected. But code chooses version 3.7.2.  I have rebooted.  It still chooses 3.7.2 .  So whatever solution does this it is not simply using the command pallet. I can find the right version by copying what Code says and running it on the command line.  But Code, does not run that command that it says it is supposed to.  – RichMeister   Sep 11, 2020 at 22:58            |  Show 4 more comments                  19               UPD . First, read the update #1 part in the bottom  (Try update#1 first) Looking at your screenshots I see you are using Code Runner extension. And I guess that is the way you are launching your programs.
I don't know how it works internally, but adding this line into Code-Runner extension setting.json file fixed it:  "code-runner.executorMap.python": {...
"python": "python3 -u",
...}  Found it in Code-Runner GitHub repository: https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner/issues/366  If you type "python --help", you'll see "-u" flag stands for "unbuffered binary stdout and stderr..." - don't know why it matters here.  Update #1 . This became not so convenient further - I started using python's virual environments and the solution above couldn't launch these environments, cause python3 (symlink) is always linking to the same python environment.  The solution here is to use Code-Runner's supported customized parameters, so you should change "python" line in it's settings.json to:  ...
"python": "$pythonPath $fullFileName",

I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out why the debug Run button used the correct interpreter (python3 from a virtual environment) but the regular (non-debug) Run used the first it found (python2).  – strobelight   Mar 3, 2021 at 20:33        Add a comment  |               11               Tot's answer is what worked for me on windows 10, with a few modifications.   File -> Preferences -> Settings  Type in "python.pythonPath" in the search bar.  Change it to what you normally run python with from the command line. If you have your Path environment variable set, that's just python . If not, it's likely the full path to the executable.

"code-runner.executorMap" and hit enter, this will copy all the settings from the default file.  Look for "python" and change the command next to it to "python3".  Save the changes and you should be good to go.

This path can be set under CTRL+SHIFT+P Python: Select Interpreter.     Path that is used when you type "python" in the terminal, and this is in "Environment Variables" in Windows 10 (Similar locations under Linux and Mac). In Windows 10 you can choose to have several Python versions, usually under C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##. Just make sure you change Environment variables C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python## and C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##\Scripts accordingly. This will also affect which pip you use, i.e. a pip that belongs to Python 3.8, or a pip that belongs to Python 3.9. Terminal in VSCode in general pertains to your default terminal I think. So in Windows 10 when you type "python" in CMD Line, it should be the same version as VSCode terminal.   For sanity purposes you should make sure that both "Python: Select Interpreter" and the system environment variables point to the same version of Python.  Bonus goodie in Windows 10. If you don't have environment variable setup, and you type 'python' in VSCode terminal, it'll point to C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe, which just opens up python link in Windows AppStore 🙄.

I found two relevant settings from an issue in Feb 2021 .
Checking the second option Python > Terminal: Activate Environment enables automatic activation of virtual environment:   In settings.json it is called "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true .  Update (8 Aug 2021):
Today when I opened the terminal from VS Code on Windows, it automatically inserted a line of code & C:/Users/[UserName]/[venv]/Scripts/Activate.ps1 to activate the appropriate environment associated with the selected python interpreter!
It appears the aforementioned settings is now the default behavior.
While there are changes to Terminal behavior in the release notes of July 2021 (version 1.59) , I don't see virtual environment activation being explicitly mentioned.  The new behavior is documented here, in " Environments and Terminal windows ".   "python.pythonPath"  has been deprecated  Therefore most previous answers are outdated.
Use "python.defaultInterpreterPath" instead:   2021.6.0 (16 June 2021) 5. Added python.defaultInterpreterPath setting at workspace level when in pythonDeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#16485) 8. Show python.pythonPath deprecation prompt when in pythonDeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#16485)    2020.7.0 (16 July 2020) 9.

Do a one-off transfer of existing values for python.pythonPath setting to new Interpreter storage if in DeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#11052) 8. Added prompt asking users to delete python.pythonPath key from their workspace settings when in Deprecate PythonPath experiment. (#11108) 12. Rename string ${config:python.pythonPath} which is used in launch.json to refer to interpreter path set in settings, to ${config:python.interpreterPath}. (#11446)    2020.4.0 (20 April 2020) 13. Added a user setting python.defaultInterpreterPath to set up the default interpreter path when in Deprecate PythonPath experiment. (#11021)   If you wish to set a default python interpreter for all workspaces, open settings with Ctrl+Shift+P , Preferences: Open User Settings and search for Python: Default Interpreter Path . Otherwise, if you want to set it for only the current workspace, use Preferences: Open Workspace Settings instead.   In your case, you wish to set it to ${workspaceFolder}/env/bin/python3.6 .
If you edit settings.json directly instead of using the GUI:  {  
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/env/bin/python3.6"
}  Detailed instructions can be found in the documentation "Manually specify an interpreter" , including using environment variables as the interpreter's path.

Bottom Screen Navigation (ease of access)   This is my quickest approach, however, it isn't always available for first-time users. If you're already using Python in VS Code, this is usually the simplest way to reach the Python: Select Interpreter menu. On the bottom left of your screen, look for "Python X.X.X ". This is the currently detected/configured version of Python in your project, and clicking it brings you to the interpreter menu to change the Python version you're using. At the time of writing, I was using Python 3.9.1 in the snippet below:    Command Palette   As @jmh denoted in his answer, you can also use the 'View' tab to navigate to the Command Palette . In the Command Palette, search for Python: Select Interpreter to then bring about the same menu denoted above.  Happy coding!

The input() function would not convert the input to a string and that's when I realized what was happening.  Typing Python in the terminal window showed 2.7 was running.  For me....  Even though "python.pythonPath" was pointing to a seemingly correct location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64), one of my environment variables was pointing to C:\Users\Mike.windows-build-tools\python27.  I deleted the environment variable and reinstalled Python 3.8 from the Microsoft Store and it immediately installed.  I got a message from VS Code (it was running) that 3.8 got installed.  I clicked Terminal/New Terminal, typed Python and it showed version 3.8.  Typed 'Python xxx.py' and the code started working as it had been.

I have tried many different things like selecting interpreter option in the left bottom corner, and settings like "python.PythonPath":"C:\\Users\\Nithin K Joy\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe","python.disableInstallationCheck":false, "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true, "python.venvPath":"C:\\Users\\Nithin K Joy\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe", whatever I do it still runs on conda environment. The only thing that worked is removing conda path from system env and running vs code. But that is not a ideal way to deal. Anyone please help. Thanks in advance.      python  python-3.x  visual-studio-code  anaconda  vscode-settings           Share    Follow         asked Aug 29, 2020 at 8:31       Nithin K Joy Nithin K Joy   768 4 4 silver badges 12 12 bronze badges         3            For me, "Python" extension saves the last selected interpreter and default settings.

By default, doesn't it become the default Python installation?  – AMC   Sep 1, 2020 at 20:45        Add a comment  |                1 Answer 1      Active  Oldest  Votes              5               You can add an entry for python.defaultInterpreterPath manually inside your User Settings，which is to set up a default interpreter for your applications. Restart the vscode to make the setting work.  Since python.pythonPath setting is being removed from all 3 scopes - User, workspace, workspace folder, more information you can refer to vscode-python-DeprecatePythonPath .

But when I add it to settings, it says "unknown configuration settings". and it didn't work.  – Nithin K Joy   Aug 31, 2020 at 9:49            Nope, i've tried and it works. what's your vscode version?  Make sure that you put it in User settings. then close the vscode and open a clean folder, create a .py file and you'll find the environment is activated and the interpreter is the one you selected before.  – Molly Wang-MSFT   Aug 31, 2020 at 10:04            I think its problem with my VScode version is 1.4.1. Anyway I uninstalled Anaconda, its a headache for me, and now I am using jupyter notebook in vs code by using Microsoft python extension. Thank you for replying and I am happy to give upvotes(2) to you.  – Nithin K Joy   Sep 1, 2020 at 11:08            @Nithin K Joy That's very kind of you, thanks a lot~  – Molly Wang-MSFT   Sep 2, 2020 at 1:19        1      @MollyWang-MSFT Thank you for your superfast response :) After some trials it seems a workspace referred defaultInterpreterPath works as I expected. But as I am using VSC Remote connected via SSH to a remote machine, VSC doesn't accept any defaultInterpreterPath config. I am stuck to VSC version 1l50.1 currently.  – fmfreeze   Nov 26, 2021 at 11:04            |  Show 4 more comments               Your Answer                  Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!

I tried the following code:  import sys
print(sys.version)  When I run the file, some reason, it shows:  3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (32-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 11:45:57) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]  I've tried the following:
  At the very bottom of VSCode, I clicked on the Python version, then clicked on "Python 3.7.3 64-bit", but when I reran the code, it still shows "3.5.2 |Anaconda..."  I also tried checking the settings, and it's showing:  Python: Python Path
    C:\Users\[MY_USE_NAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe  I also tried just typing "python" in the command like, and it still says "Python 3.5.2".

It will show you available interpreters (virtual environments + the global environment) to choose.  If you want to change version of python you are using , you must first create a virtual environment with desired version of python and then choose it as your interpreter. (I recommend to create it in .venv directory in the root directory of your project)  This answer will help you with that.

Or you also can do Python: Run Selection/Line in Python terminal on some non empty line of the source code to open the python shell, but it is hacky. The problem is that when you open the intergrated terminal it still uses PATH variable to find python executable.  – ThatAnnoyingDude   Oct 20, 2019 at 7:52               Thanks.  Updating the Path worked.  But is my setup not working correctly?  I would have thought that selecting the environment in VSCode would make that the default.  I thought that selector on the bottom left corner of VS code was there so that I could switch back and forth easier. Or am I not understanding correctly?  – NL3294   Oct 20, 2019 at 17:32        1      It is for changing the path for python that Python extension will use to run/debug your scripts and provide intellisense. It doesn't affect the intergrated terminal though.  – ThatAnnoyingDude   Oct 20, 2019 at 18:55        1      @ThatAnnoyingDude, your last comment is not true anymore.

All you now need to do is make use of the command Select Workspace Interpreter from the command palette and select an interpreter from the list.
If the interpreter you are looking for isn’t listed here, then please proceed to the next section and enter it manually.  Manual Configuration  Python Version used for Intellisense, Autocomplete, Linting, Formatting, etc The same python interpreter is used for intellisense, autocomplete, linting, formatting, etc. (everything other than debugging). The standard interpreter used is the first “python” interpreter encountered in the current path.  If a specific version is to be used, then configure the path to the python interpreter in the User or Workspace Settings file (settings.json) as follows. Ensure to specify the fully qualified name of the python executable (Mac and Linux supported).  "python.pythonPath": "c:/python27/python.exe"  Virtual Environments  There are two approaches to to getting this extension working in a particular Virtual Environment.  Option 1: Ensure the path to the python interpreter is set in python.pythonPath as defined previously.  Note: Do remember to configure the pythonPath in launch.json as well.  { "python.pythonPath" : "/home/xxx/dev/ala/venv/bin/python" }  Finally, restart VS Code, necessary for intellisense to work (future release will not require a restart) Ensure the libraries/modules you plan on using for linting are also installed within this virtual environment.  Option 2: Activate the Virtual Environment from your Terminal/Command Window and then launch VS Code.   Ensure none of the Python paths are configured in the settings.json file (leave them to their defaults).  Open your terminal (command) window and activate the relevant Python environment  Close all instances of VS Code  Next, launch VS Code from that same terminal (command window) session   (venv) ter @minal :~ $ code .  Python Version used for debugging  Details on configuration settings for debugging can be found here Debugging .  Configuring the version of the python executable is no longer necessary. Provided the setting python.pythonPath in settings.json (see above) has been configured correctly, the debugger will use this same setting.  This is made possible by setting the value of the pythonPath setting to ${config.python.pythonPath} . I.e. the debugger merely references the pythonPath setting from the settings.json file.  { "name" : "Python" , "type" : "python" , "request" : "launch" , "stopOnEntry" : true , "program" : "${file}" , "pythonPath" : "${config.python.pythonPath}" , "debugOptions" : [ "WaitOnAbnormalExit" , "WaitOnNormalExit" , "RedirectOutput" ]
}  Relative Paths to Python Interpreter  Unfortunately use of relative paths when configuring the interpreter in settings.json will not work with the debugger. Hence the solution is to provide the fully qualified path.
This could be achieved with the use of simple variables such as the following: Where ${workspaceRoot} resolves to the current work space (project) directory.  { "python.pythonPath" : "${workspaceRoot}/venv/bin/python" }  Environment Variables  Similar to the use of ${workspaceRoot} , environment variables could be used in configuring the path to the python interpreter.
Where ${env.PYTHONPATH} resolves to the value of the environment variable xyz.  { "python.pythonPath" : "${env.PYTHONPATH}/venv/bin/python" }  Topics:  Python Path and Version Autocomplete Formatting Linting Debugging -> Terminal (Console) Apps -> Capture User Input -> Library Functions -> Google App Engine -> Remote Debugging -> nosetests -> py.test -> Flask -> Sudo (root privileges) -> Django Unittests -> More Options -> unittest -> py.test -> nose Refactoring -> Rename -> Extract Variables -> Extract Method -> Sort Imports Jupyter (IPython) -> Getting Started -> Prerequisites -> Configuration -> Examples Miscellaneous Contribution Workspace Symbols Troubleshooting -> Debugger -> Virtual Env -> Linting -> Formatting -> Autocomplete -> Jupyter Roadmap Python Path and Version By default the extension uses the Python interpreter available in the current path.

Note: Do remember to configure the pythonPath in launch.json as well.  { "python.pythonPath" : "/home/xxx/dev/ala/venv/bin/python" }  Finally, restart VS Code, necessary for intellisense to work (future release will not require a restart) Ensure the libraries/modules you plan on using for linting are also installed within this virtual environment.  Option 2: Activate the Virtual Environment from your Terminal/Command Window and then launch VS Code.   Ensure none of the Python paths are configured in the settings.json file (leave them to their defaults).  Open your terminal (command) window and activate the relevant Python environment  Close all instances of VS Code  Next, launch VS Code from that same terminal (command window) session   (venv) ter @minal :~ $ code .  Python Version used for debugging  Details on configuration settings for debugging can be found here Debugging .  Configuring the version of the python executable is no longer necessary. Provided the setting python.pythonPath in settings.json (see above) has been configured correctly, the debugger will use this same setting.  This is made possible by setting the value of the pythonPath setting to ${config.python.pythonPath} . I.e. the debugger merely references the pythonPath setting from the settings.json file.  { "name" : "Python" , "type" : "python" , "request" : "launch" , "stopOnEntry" : true , "program" : "${file}" , "pythonPath" : "${config.python.pythonPath}" , "debugOptions" : [ "WaitOnAbnormalExit" , "WaitOnNormalExit" , "RedirectOutput" ]
}  Relative Paths to Python Interpreter  Unfortunately use of relative paths when configuring the interpreter in settings.json will not work with the debugger. Hence the solution is to provide the fully qualified path.
This could be achieved with the use of simple variables such as the following: Where ${workspaceRoot} resolves to the current work space (project) directory.  { "python.pythonPath" : "${workspaceRoot}/venv/bin/python" }  Environment Variables  Similar to the use of ${workspaceRoot} , environment variables could be used in configuring the path to the python interpreter.
Where ${env.PYTHONPATH} resolves to the value of the environment variable xyz.  { "python.pythonPath" : "${env.PYTHONPATH}/venv/bin/python" }  19    Skip to main content     This browser is no longer supported.

An environment consists of an interpreter, a library (typically the Python Standard Library), and a set of installed packages. These components together determine valid language constructs and syntax, operating-system functionality that you can access, and packages you can use.  In Visual Studio on Windows, you use the Python Environments window, as described in this article, to manage environments and select one as the default for new projects. Other aspects of environments are found in the following articles:   For any given project, you can select a specific environment rather than use the default.   For details on creating and using virtual environments for Python projects, see Use virtual environments .   If you want to install packages in an environment, refer to the Packages tab reference .   To install another Python interpreter, see Install Python interpreters . In general, if you download and run an installer for a mainline Python distribution, Visual Studio detects that new installation and the environment appears in the Python Environments window and can be selected for projects.    If you're new to Python in Visual Studio, the following articles also provide from general background:   Work with Python in Visual Studio  Install Python support in Visual Studio     Note  You can't manage environments for Python code that is opened only as a folder using the File > Open > Folder command. Instead, Create a Python project from existing code to enjoy the environment features of Visual Studio.      Note  You can manage environments for Python code that is opened as a folder using the File > Open > Folder command. The Python toolbar allows you switch between all detected environments, and also add a new environment. The environment information is stored in the PythonSettings.json file in the Workspace .vs folder.    The Python Environments window  The environments that Visual Studio knows about are displayed in the Python Environments window. To open the window, use one of the following methods:   Select the View > Other Windows > Python Environments menu command.  Right-click the Python Environments node for a project in Solution Explorer and select View All Python Environments :            In all these cases, the Python Environments window appears alongside Solution Explorer :           Visual Studio looks for installed global environments using the registry (following PEP 514 ), along with virtual environments and conda environments (see Types of environments ). If you don't see an expected environment in the list, see Manually identify an existing environment .  When you select an environment in the list, Visual Studio displays various properties and commands for that environment on the Overview tab.   For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Python36-32 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2017- Overview .    For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Python36-32 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2019- Overview .    For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Python310 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2022- Overview .   Use the drop-down list below the list of environments to switch to different tabs such as Packages , and IntelliSense . These tabs are also described in the Python Environments window tab reference .  Selecting an environment doesn't change its relation to any projects. The default environment, shown in boldface in the list, is the one that Visual Studio uses for any new projects. To use a different environment with new projects, use the Make this the default environment for new projects command. Within the context of a project, you can always select a specific environment. For more information, see Select an environment for a project .  To the right of each listed environment, is a control that opens an Interactive window for that environment. (In Visual Studio 2017 15.5 and earlier, another control appears that refreshes the IntelliSense database for that environment. See Environments window tab reference for details about the database.)    Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.      Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.      Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.     Note  Although Visual Studio respects the system-site-packages option, it doesn't provide a way to change it from within Visual Studio.   What if no environments appear?  If no environments appear, it means Visual Studio failed to detect any Python installations in standard locations. For example, you might have installed Visual Studio 2017 or later but cleared all the interpreter options in the installer options for the Python workload. Similarly, you might have installed Visual Studio 2015 or earlier but didn't install an interpreter manually (see Install Python interpreters ).  If you know you have a Python interpreter on your computer but Visual Studio (any version) didn't detect it, then use the + Custom command to specify its location manually. See the next section, Manually identify an existing environment .    Tip  Visual Studio detects updates to an existing interpreter, such as upgrading Python 2.7.11 to 2.7.14 using the installers from python.org. During the installation process, the older environment disappears from the Python Environments list before the update appears in its place.    However, if you manually move an interpreter and its environment using the file system, Visual Studio won't know the new location. For more information, see Move an interpreter .    Types of environments  Visual Studio can work with global, virtual, and conda environments.  Global environments  Each Python installation maintains its own global environment . For example, Python 2.7, Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Anaconda 4.4.0, and so on. See Install Python interpreters )  Each environment is composed of the specific Python interpreter, its standard library, a set of pre-installed packages, and any other packages you install while that environment is activated. Installing a package into a global environment makes it available to all projects using that environment. If the environment is located in a protected area of the file system (within c:\program files , for example), then installing packages requires administrator privileges.  Global environments are available to all projects on the computer. In Visual Studio, you select one global environment as the default, which is used for all projects unless you specifically choose a different one for a project. For more information, see Select an environment for a project .  Virtual environments  Working in a global environment is an easy way to get started. Over time, the environments become cluttered with many different packages that you've installed for different projects. Such clutter makes it difficult to thoroughly test your application against a specific set of packages with known versions. But,  the kind of environment is exactly as above that you'd set up on a build server or web server. Conflicts can also occur when two projects require incompatible packages or different versions of the same package.  For this reason, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. If you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you then run a Python program within that environment, you know that it's running against only those specific packages.  Visual Studio provides direct support for creating a virtual environment for a project. For example, if you open a project that contains a requirements.txt , or create a project from a template that includes that file, Visual Studio prompts you automatically to create a virtual environment and install those dependencies.  At any time within an open project, you can create a new virtual environment. In Solution Explorer , expand the project node, right-click Python Environments , and choose Add environment . In Add Environment , choose Virtual environment .   For more information, see Create a virtual environment-2019 .    For more information, see Create a virtual environment-2022 .   Visual Studio also provides a command to generate a requirements.txt file from a virtual environment, making it easy to recreate the environment on other computers. For more information, see Use virtual environments .  Conda environments  A conda environment is one you create using the conda tool, or with integrated conda management in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and higher. (Requires Anaconda or Miniconda, which are available through the Visual Studio installer, see Install Visual Studio 2017    Select + Create conda environment in the Python Environments window, which opens a Create new conda environment tab:    Enter a name for the environment in the Name field, select a base Python interpreter in the Python field, and select Create .   The Output window shows progress for the new environment, with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Conda environment tab:    Configure the following fields:     Field  Description      Project  The project in which to create the environment (if you have multiple projects in the same Visual Studio solution).    Name  The name for the conda environment.    Add packages from  Choose Environment file if you have an environment.yml file describing your dependencies, or choose One or more Anaconda package names and list at least one Python package or a Python version in the field below. The package list instructs conda to create a Python environment. To install the latest version of Python, use python ; to install a specific version, use python=,major>.<minor> as in python=3.7 . You can also use the package button to select Python versions and common packages from a series of menus.    Set as current environment  Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created.    Set as default environment for new projects  Automatically sets and activates the conda environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. This option is the same as using the Make this the default environment for new projects in the Python Environments window.    View in Python Environments window  Specifies whether to show the Python Environments window after creating the environment.      Important  When creating a conda environment, be sure to specify at least one Python version or Python package using either environments.yml or the package list, which ensures that the environment contains a Python runtime. Otherwise, Visual Studio ignores the environment: the environment doesn't appear anywhere the Python Environments window, isn't be set as the current environment for a project, and isn't available as a global environment.  If you happen to create a conda environment without a Python version, use the conda info command to see the locations of conda environment folders, then manually remove the subfolder for the environment from that location.    Select Create , and observe progress in the Output window.    The output includes with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install more packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Conda environment tab:    Configure the following fields:     Field  Description      Project  The project in which to create the environment (if you have multiple projects in the same Visual Studio solution).    Name  The name for the conda environment.    Add packages from  Choose Environment file if you have an environment.yml file describing your dependencies, or choose One or more Anaconda package names and list at least one Python package or a Python version in the field below. The package list instructs conda to create a Python environment. To install the latest version of Python, use python ; to install a specific version, use python=,major>.<minor> as in python=3.7 . You can also use the package button to select Python versions and common packages from a series of menus.    Set as current environment  Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created.    Set as default environment for new projects  Automatically sets and activates the conda environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. This option is the same as using the Make this the default environment for new projects in the Python Environments window.    View in Python Environments window  Specifies whether to show the Python Environments window after creating the environment.      Important  When creating a conda environment, be sure to specify at least one Python version or Python package using either environments.yml or the package list, which ensures that the environment contains a Python runtime. Otherwise, Visual Studio ignores the environment: the environment doesn't appear anywhere the Python Environments window, isn't be set as the current environment for a project, and isn't available as a global environment.  If you happen to create a conda environment without a Python version, use the conda info command to see the locations of conda environment folders, then manually remove the subfolder for the environment from that location.    Select Create , and observe progress in the Output window. The output includes with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install more packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .      Note  For best results with conda environments, use conda 4.4.8 or later (conda versions are different from Anaconda versions). You can install suitable versions of Miniconda (Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022) and Anaconda (Visual Studio 2017) through the Visual Studio installer.   To see the conda version, where conda environments are stored, and other information, run conda info at an Anaconda command prompt (that is, a command prompt where Anaconda is in the path):  conda info  Your conda environment folders appear as follows:  envs directories : C:\Users\user\.conda\envs
                          c:\anaconda3\envs
                          C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs  Because conda environments aren't stored with a project, they act similarly to global environments. For example, installing a new package into a conda environment makes that package available to all projects using that environment.  For Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 and earlier, you can use conda environments by pointing to them manually as described under Manually identify an existing environment .  Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later detects conda environments automatically and displays them in the Python Environments window as described in the next section.  Manually identify an existing environment  Use the following steps to identify an environment that's installed in a non-standard location:   Use the following steps to identify an environment that's installed in a non-standard location (including conda environments in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 and earlier):   Select + Custom in the Python Environments window, which opens the Configure tab:    Enter a name for the environment in the Description field.   Enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter in the Prefix path field.   If Visual Studio detects a Python interpreter at that location (such as the path shown below for a conda environment), it enables the Auto Detect command. Selecting Auto Detect completes the remaining fields. You can also complete those fields manually.     Once the fields contain the values you want, select Apply to save the configuration. You can now use the environment like any other within Visual Studio.   If you need to remove a manually identified environment, select the Remove command on the Configure tab. Autodetected environments don't provide this option. For more information, see Configure tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Existing environment tab:    Select the Environment drop-down, then select Custom :    In the provided fields in the dialog box, enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter under Prefix path , which fills in most of the other fields.   After reviewing those values and modifying as necessary, select Add .     You can also review and modify details of the environment at any time in the Python Environments window.   In Python environment window, select the environment, and then select the Configure tab.   After making changes, select the Apply command.
You can also remove the environment using the Remove command (not available for autodetected environments). For more information, see Configure tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Existing environment tab:   For example, select an existing environment and the path to the existing environment.   Select the Environment drop-down, then select Custom :  .  For example, Anaconda 2021.05 in C:\Users\user\Anaconda3\python.exe   In the provided fields in the dialog box, enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter under Prefix path , which fills in most of the other fields.   After reviewing those values and modifying as necessary, select Add .    You can also review and modify details of the environment at any time in the Python Environments window.   In the Python environment window, select the environment, and then select the Configure tab.   After making changes, select the Apply command.
You can also remove the environment using the Remove command (not available for autodetected environments). For more information, see Configure tab .     Fix or delete invalid environments  If Visual Studio finds registry entries for an environment, but the path to the interpreter is invalid, then the Python Environments window shows the name with a strikeout font:        To correct an environment you wish to keep, first try using its installer's Repair process. The installers for standard Python 3.x, for example, include that option.  Modify the registry to correct an environment that doesn't have a repair option, or to remove an invalid environment  Use the following steps to modify the registry directly. Visual Studio automatically updates the Python Environments window when you make changes to the registry.   Run regedit.exe .   Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python . For IronPython, look for IronPython instead.   Expand the node that matches the distribution, such as Python Core for CPython or ContinuumAnalytics for Anaconda. For IronPython, expand the version number node.   Inspect the values under the InstallPath node:    If the environment still exists on your computer, change the value of ExecutablePath to the correct location. Also correct the (Default) and WindowedExecutablePath values as necessary.  If the environment no longer exists on your computer and you want to remove it from the Python Environments window, delete the parent node of InstallPath , such as 3.6 in the image above.  Invalid settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python override the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python     See also   Install Python interpreters  Select an interpreter for a project  Use requirements.txt for dependencies  Search paths  Python Environments window reference           Feedback   Submit and view feedback for    This product     This page        View all page feedback                      Theme                     Light                    Dark                    High contrast           Previous Version Docs  Blog  Contribute  Privacy & Cookies  Terms of Use  Trademarks  © Microsoft 2022         In this article                              Theme                     Light                    Dark                    High contrast           Previous Version Docs  Blog  Contribute  Privacy & Cookies  Terms of Use  Trademarks  © Microsoft 2022      20    Skip to main content     This browser is no longer supported.

In this article    All code in a Python project runs within the context of a specific environment, such as a global Python environment, an Anaconda environment, a virtual environment, or a conda environment. Visual Studio also uses that environment for debugging, import and member completions, syntax checking, and any other tasks that require language services that are specific to the Python version and a set of installed packages.  All new Python projects in Visual Studio are initially configured to use the default global environment, which appears under the Python Environments node in Solution Explorer :    To change the environment for a project, right-click the Python Environments node and select Add/Remove Python Environments . From the displayed list, which includes global, virtual, and conda environments, select all the ones you want to appear under the Python Environments node:   Once you select OK , all the selected environments appear under the Python Environments node. The currently activated environment appears in bold:   To quickly activate a different environment, right-click that environment name and select Activate environment . Your choice is saved with the project and that environment is activated whenever you open the project in the future. If you clear all the options in the Add/Remove Python Environments dialog, Visual Studio activates the global default environment.  The context menu on the Python Environments node also provides additional commands:     Command  Description      Add Virtual Environment  Begins the process of creating a new virtual environment in the project. See Create a virtual environment .    Add Existing Virtual Environment  Prompts you to select a folder that contains a virtual environment and adds it to the list under Python Environments , but does not activate it. See Activate an existing virtual environment .    Create Conda environment  Switches to the Python Environments  window in which you enter a name for the environment and specify its base interpreter. See Conda environments .       To change the environment for a project, right-click the Python Environments node and select Add Environment . You can also select Add Environment from the environment drop-down in the Python toolbar.  Once in the Add Environment dialog box, select the Existing environment tab, then select a new environment from the Environment drop-down list:   If you already added an environment other than the global default to a project, you might need to activate a newly added environment. Right-click that environment under the Python Environments node and select Activate Environment . To remove an environment from the project, select Remove .    Use virtual environments  A virtual environment is a unique combination of a specific Python interpreter and a specific set of libraries that is different from other global and conda environments. A virtual environment is specific to a project and is maintained in a project folder. That folder contains the environment's installed libraries along with a pyvenv.cfg file that specifies the path to the environment's base interpreter elsewhere on the file system. (That is, a virtual environment doesn't contain a copy of the interpreter, only a link to it.)  A benefit to using a virtual environment is that as you develop project over time, the virtual environment always reflects the exact dependencies of the project. (A shared global environment, on the other hand, contains any number of libraries whether you use them in your project or not.) You can then easily create a requirements.txt file from the virtual environment, which is then used to reinstall those dependencies on another development or production computer. For more information, see Manage required packages with requirements.txt .  When you open a project in Visual Studio that contains a requirements.txt file, Visual Studio automatically gives you the option to recreate the virtual environment. On computers where Visual Studio isn't installed, you can use pip install -r requirements.txt to restore the packages.  Because a virtual environment contains a hard-coded path to the base interpreter, and because you can recreate the environment using requirements.txt , you typically omit the entire virtual environment folder from source control.  The following sections explain how to activate an existing virtual environment in a project and how to create a new virtual environment.  In Visual Studio, a virtual environment can be activated for a project like any other through the Python Environments node in Solution Explorer .  Once a virtual environment is added to your project, it appears in the Python Environments window. You can then activate it like any other environment, and you can manage its packages.   Create a virtual environment  You can create a new virtual environment directly in Visual Studio as follows:   Right-click Python Environments in Solution Explorer and select Add Virtual Environment , which brings up the following dialog box:    In the Location of the virtual environment field, specify a path for the virtual environment. If you specify a name only, the virtual environment is created within the current project in a subfolder with that name.   Select an environment as the base interpreter and select Create . Visual Studio displays a progress bar while it configures the environment and downloads any necessary packages. Upon completion, the virtual environment appears in the Python Environments window for the containing project.   The virtual environment is not activated by default. To activate the virtual environment for the project, right-click it and select Activate Environment .     Note  If the location path identifies an existing virtual environment, Visual Studio detects the base interpreter automatically (using the orig-prefix.txt file in the environment's lib directory) and changes the Create button to Add .  If a requirements.txt file exists when adding a virtual environment, the Add Virtual Environment dialog displays an option to install the packages automatically, making it easy to recreate an environment on another computer:   Either way, the result is the same as if you'd used the Add Existing Virtual Environment command.   Activate an existing virtual environment  If you've already created a virtual environment elsewhere, you can activate it for a project as follows:   Right-click Python Environments in Solution Explorer and select Add Existing Virtual Environment .   In the Browse dialog that appears, navigate to and select the folder that contains the virtual environment, and select OK . If Visual Studio detects a requirements.txt file in that environment, it asks whether to install those packages.   After a few moments, the virtual environment appears under the Python Environments node in Solution Explorer . The virtual environment is not activated by default, so right-click it and select Activate Environment .      Create a virtual environment  You can create a new virtual environment directly in Visual Studio as follows:   Right-click Python Environments in Solution Explorer and select Add Environment , or select Add Environment from the environments drop down list on the Python toolbar. In the Add Environment dialog that appears, select the Virtual Environment tab:    Specify a name for the virtual environment, select a base interpreter, and verify its location. Under Install packages from file , provide the path to a requirements.txt file if desired.   Review the other options in the dialog:     Option  Description      Set as current environment  Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created.    Set as default environment for new projects  Automatically sets and activates the virtual environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. When using this option, the virtual environment should be placed in a location outside of a specific project.    View in Python Environments window  Specifies whether to open the Python Environments window after creating the environment.    Make this environment available globally  Specifies whether the virtual environment also acts as a global environment. When using this option, the virtual environment should be placed in a location outside of a specific project.      Select Create to finalize the virtual environment. Visual Studio displays a progress bar while it configures the environment and downloads any necessary packages. Upon completion, the virtual environment is activated and appears in the Python Environments node in Solution Explorer and the Python Environments window for the containing project.    Activate an existing virtual environment  If you've already created a virtual environment elsewhere, you can activate it for a project as follows:   Right-click Python Environments in Solution Explorer and select Add Environment .   In the Browse dialog that appears, navigate to and select the folder that contains the virtual environment, and select OK . If Visual Studio detects a requirements.txt file in that environment, it asks whether to install those packages.   After a few moments, the virtual environment appears under the Python Environments node in Solution Explorer . The virtual environment is not activated by default, so right-click it and select Activate Environment .     Remove a virtual environment   In Solution Explorer , right-click the virtual environment and select Remove .   Visual Studio asks whether to remove or delete the virtual environment. Selecting Remove makes it unavailable to the project but leaves it on the file system. Selecting Delete both removes the environment from the project and deletes it from the file system. The base interpreter is unaffected.    View installed packages  In Solution Explorer, expand any specific environment's node to quickly view the packages that are installed in that environment (that is, you can import and use those packages in your code when the environment is active):    To install new packages, right-click the environment and select Install Python Package to switch to the appropriate Packages tab in the Python Environments window. Enter a search term (usually the package name) and Visual Studio displays matching packages.    To install new packages, right-click the environment and select Manage Python Packages (or use the package button on the Python toolbar) to switch to the appropriate Packages tab in the Python Environments window. Once in the Packages tab, enter a search term (usually the package name) and Visual Studio displays matching packages.   Within Visual Studio, packages (and dependencies) for most environments are downloaded from the Python Package Index (PyPI) , where you can also search for available packages. Visual Studio's status bar and output window show information about the install. To uninstall a package, right-click it and select Remove .  The conda package manager generally uses https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/ as the default channel, but other channels are available. For more information, see Manage Channels (docs.conda.io).  Be aware that the displayed entries may not always be accurate, and installation and uninstallation may not be reliable or available. Visual Studio uses the pip package manager if available, and downloads and installs it when required. Visual Studio can also use the easy_install package manager. Packages installed using pip or easy_install from the command line are also displayed.  Also note that Visual Studio doesn't presently support using conda to install packages into a conda environment. Use conda from the command line instead.   Tip  A common situation where pip fails to install a package is when the package includes source code for native components in *.pyd files. Without the required version of Visual Studio installed, pip cannot compile these components. The error message displayed in this situation is error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat . easy_install is often able to download pre-compiled binaries, and you can download a suitable compiler for older versions of Python from https://python.en.uptodown.com/windows/versions . For more details, see How to deal with the pain of "unable to find vcvarsallbat" on the Python tools team blog.

An "environment" in Python is the context in which a Python program runs and consists of an interpreter and any number of installed packages. After you finish this article, you'll have a good understanding of:   General environment concepts  How to select an environment  How to create a virtual or conda environment  How to select and activate a virtual environment  How to work with Environments and Terminal windows  Where the Python extension looks for environments  Environment variables and environment variable definitions files (.env)   While this article provides some information about Python environments and their concepts, it is primarily for understanding how to work with them within VS Code. If you're new to working with Python environments, you can learn more at Virtual Environments and Packages (Python.org) and Installing Python Modules (Python.org) .   Note : If you're looking to get started with Python in Visual Studio Code, refer to the tutorial Getting Started with Python in VS Code . The Python tutorial (Python.org) might also be helpful if you're new to the Python language.   Global and virtual environments  By default, any Python interpreter that you've installed runs in its own global environment , which is not specific to any one project. For example, if you just run python (Windows) or python3 (macOS/Linux) at a new command prompt, you're running in that interpreter's global environment. Accordingly, any packages that you install or uninstall affect the global environment and all programs that you run within that context.  Although working in the global environment is an easy way to get started, that environment will, over time, become cluttered with many different packages that you've installed for different projects. Such clutter makes it difficult to thoroughly test an application against a specific set of packages with known versions, which is exactly the kind of environment you'd set up on a build server or web server.  For this reason, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. When you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you then run a Python program within that environment, you know that it's running against only those specific packages. Be aware that if you're not using a virtual environment , and you have multiple versions of Python installed and set in the path environment variable, you might need to specify the Python interpreter to use in the terminal for installing packages to the global environment.   Note : While it's possible to open a virtual environment folder as a workspace, doing so is not recommended and might cause issues with using the Python extension.   Conda environments  A conda environment is a Python environment that's managed using the conda package manager (see Getting started with conda (conda.io)). Conda works well to create environments with interrelated dependencies as well as binary packages. Unlike virtual environments, which are scoped to a project, conda environments are available globally on any given computer. This availability makes it easy to configure several distinct conda environments and then choose the appropriate one for any given project.  Where the extension looks for environments  The extension automatically looks for interpreters in the following locations:   Standard install paths such as /usr/local/bin , /usr/sbin , /sbin , c:\\python27 , c:\\python36 , etc.  Virtual environments located directly under the workspace (project) folder.  Virtual environments located in the folder identified by the python.venvPath setting (see General settings ), which can contain multiple virtual environments. The extension looks for virtual environments in the first-level subfolders of venvPath .  Virtual environments located in a ~/.virtualenvs folder for virtualenvwrapper .  Interpreters installed by pyenv , Pipenv , and Poetry .  Virtual environments located in the path identified by WORKON_HOME (as used by virtualenvwrapper ).  Conda environments that contain a Python interpreter. VS Code does not show conda environments that don't contain an interpreter.  Interpreters installed in a .direnv folder for direnv under the workspace (project) folder.   You can also manually specify an interpreter if Visual Studio Code does not locate it automatically.   Note : Once the "select interpreter" flow is triggered, pipenv environments for the workspace folder will be searched for. If one is found, then no other interpreters are searched for or listed as pipenv expects to manage all aspects.   The extension also loads an environment variable definitions file identified by the python.envFile setting. The default value of this setting is ${workspaceFolder}/.env .  Work with environments  Create a virtual environment  To create a virtual environment, use the following command, where ".venv" is the name of the environment folder:  # macOS/Linux  # You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first  python3 -m venv .venv  # Windows  # You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv  python -m venv .venv   Note : To learn more about the venv module, see Creation of virtual environments on Python.org.   When you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed to allow you to select it for the workspace.   This will add the path to the Python interpreter from the new virtual environment to your workspace settings. That environment will then be used when installing packages and running code through the Python extension. For examples of using virtual environment in projects, see the Python , Django , and Flask tutorials.   Tip : When you're ready to deploy the application to other computers, you can create a requirements.txt file with the command pip freeze > requirements.txt ( pip3 on macOS/Linux). The requirements file describes the packages you've installed in your virtual environment. With only this file, you or other developers can restore those packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (or, again, pip3 on macOS/Linux). By using a requirements file, you need not commit the virtual environment itself to source control.   Create a conda environment  The Python extension automatically detects existing conda environments provided that the environment contains a Python interpreter. For example, the following command creates a conda environment with the Python 3.4 interpreter and several libraries, which VS Code then shows in the list of available interpreters:  conda create -n env-01 python=3.4 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel  In contrast, if you fail to specify an interpreter, as with conda create --name env-00 , the environment won't appear in the list.  For more information on the conda command line, see Conda environments (conda.io).  Additional notes:    If you create a new conda environment while VS Code is running, use the Reload Window command to refresh the environment list shown with Python: Select Interpreter ; otherwise you may not see the environment there. It might take a short time to appear; if you don't see it at first, wait 15 seconds then try using the command again.    To ensure the environment is set up well from a shell perspective, one option is to use an Anaconda prompt with the activated environment to launch VS Code using the code . command. At that point you just need to select the interpreter using the Command Palette or by clicking on the status bar.    Although the Python extension for VS Code doesn't currently have direct integration with conda environment.yml files, VS Code itself is a great YAML editor.    Conda environments can't be automatically activated in the VS Code Integrated Terminal if the default shell is set to PowerShell. To change the shell, see Integrated terminal - Configuration .    You can manually specify the path to the conda executable to use for activation (version 4.4+). To do so, open the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings . Then set python.condaPath , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate path.    Select and activate an environment  By default, the Python extension looks for and uses the first Python interpreter it finds in the system path. To select a specific environment, use the Python: Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ).    Note : If the Python extension doesn't find an interpreter, it issues a warning. On macOS, the extension also issues a warning if you're using the OS-installed Python interpreter, because you typically want to use an interpreter you install directly. In either case, you can disable these warnings by setting python.disableInstallationCheck to true in your user settings .   You can switch environments at any time; switching environments helps you test different parts of your project with different interpreters or library versions as needed.  The Python: Select Interpreter command displays a list of available global environments, conda environments, and virtual environments. (See the Where the extension looks for environments section for details, including the distinctions between these types of environments.) The following image, for example, shows several Anaconda and CPython installations along with a conda environment and a virtual environment ( env ) that's located within the workspace folder:    Note: On Windows, it can take a little time for VS Code to detect available conda environments. During that process, you may see "(cached)" before the path to an environment. The label indicates that VS Code is presently working with cached information for that environment.   If you have a folder or a workspace open in VS Code and you select an interpreter from the list, the Python extension will store that information internally so that the same interpreter will be used once you reopen the workspace.  The Python extension uses the selected environment for running Python code (using the Python: Run Python File in Terminal command), providing language services (auto-complete, syntax checking, linting, formatting, etc.) when you have a .py file open in the editor, and opening a terminal with the Terminal: Create New Terminal command. In the latter case, VS Code automatically activated the selected environment.   Tip : To prevent automatic activation of a selected environment, add "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false to your settings.json file (it can be placed anywhere as a sibling to the existing settings).    Tip : If the activate command generates the message "Activate.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the
current system.", then you need to temporarily change the PowerShell execution policy to allow scripts to
run (see About Execution Policies in the PowerShell documentation): Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process    Note : By default, VS Code uses the interpreter selected for your workspace when debugging code. You can override this behavior by specifying a different path in the python property of a debug configuration. See Choose a debugging environment .   The Status Bar always shows the current interpreter.   The Status Bar also reflects when no interpreter is selected.   In either case, clicking this area of the Status Bar is a convenient shortcut for the Python: Select Interpreter command.   Tip : If you have any problems with VS Code recognizing a virtual environment, please file an issue in the extension repository so we can help determine the cause.   Manually specify an interpreter  If VS Code does not automatically locate an interpreter you want to use, you can browse for the interpreter on your file system or provide the path to it manually.  You can do so by running the Python: Select Interpreter command and clicking on the Enter interpreter path... option that shows on the top of the interpreters list:   You can then either enter the full path of the Python interpreter directly in the text box (for example, ".venv/Scripts/python.exe"), or you can click on the Find... button and browse your file system to find the python executable you wish to select.   If you want to manually specify a default interpreter that will be used once you first open your workspace, you can create or modify an entry for python.defaultInterpreterPath setting in your workspace settings.json with the full path to the Python executable.  For example:    Windows:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "c:/python39/python.exe"  }    macOS/Linux:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "/home/python39/python"  }    You can also use python.defaultInterpreterPath to point to a virtual environment, for example:    Windows:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "c:/dev/ala/venv/Scripts/python.exe"  }    macOS/Linux:  {   "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "/home/abc/dev/ala/venv/bin/python"  }     Note : Changes to the python.defaultInterpreterPath setting are not picked up after an interpreter has already been selected for a workspace; any changes to the setting will be ignored once an initial interpreter is selected for the workspace.   Additionally, if you'd like to set up a default interpreter to all of your Python applications, you can add an entry for python.defaultInterpreterPath manually inside your User Settings. To do so, open the Command Palette ( ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P ) ) and enter Preferences: Open User Settings . Then set python.defaultInterpreterPath , which is in the Python extension section of User Settings, with the appropriate interpreter.  You can also use an environment variable in the path setting using the syntax ${env:VARIABLE} . For example, if you've created a variable named PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC with a path to an interpreter, you can then use the following setting value:  "python.defaultInterpreterPath" : "${env:PYTHON_INSTALL_LOC}" ,   Note : Variable substitution is only supported in VS Code settings files, it will not work in .env environment files.   By using an environment variable, you can easily transfer a project between operating systems where the paths are different, just be sure to set the environment variable on the operating system first.  Environments and Terminal windows  After using Python: Select Interpreter , that interpreter is applied when right-clicking a file and selecting Python: Run Python File in Terminal . The environment is also activated automatically when you use the Terminal: Create New Terminal command unless you change the python.terminal.activateEnvironment setting to false .  However, launching VS Code from a shell in which a certain Python environment is activated does not automatically activate that environment in the default Integrated Terminal. Use the Terminal: Create New Terminal command after VS Code is running.   Note: conda environments cannot be automatically activated in the integrated terminal if PowerShell is set as the integrated shell. See Integrated terminal - Configuration for how to change the shell.   Any changes you make to an activated environment within the terminal are persistent. For example, using conda install <package> from the terminal with a conda environment activated installs the package into that environment permanently. Similarly, using pip install in a terminal with a virtual environment activated adds the package to that environment.  Changing interpreters with the Python: Select Interpreter command doesn't affect terminal panels that are already open. You can thus activate separate environments in a split terminal: select the first interpreter, create a terminal for it, select a different interpreter, then use the split button ( ⌘\ (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+5 ) ) in the terminal title bar.  Choose a debugging environment  By default, the debugger will use the Python interpreter you have selected with the Python extension. However, if you have a python property in the debug configuration of launch.json , that interpreter is used instead. To be more specific, VS Code will give precedence to the python property of the selected debug configuration in launch.json . If it's not defined, then it will use the path to the Python interpreter you have selected for your workspace.  For more details on debug configuration, see Debugging configurations .  Limited support for Python 2.7  The Python extension no longer offers IntelliSense support for Python 2.7 with Jedi as it only supports Python 3 at this point. When using Python 2.7 with the Python extension you can customize the language server setting to either turn off auto-completions or select Pylance as your language server, as it may provide a good experience if the code is compatible enough with Python 3.  We currently support selecting Python 2.7 as an interpreter in your workspace. Because Python 2.7 is no longer maintained as of January 2020 , we strongly suggest you to upgrade your code to Python 3 as soon as you can. You can learn how to port your code to Python 3 if you need help.  Environment variables  Environment variable definitions file  An environment variable definitions file is a simple text file containing key-value pairs in the form of environment_variable=value , with # used for comments. Multiline values are not supported, but values can refer to any other environment variable that's already defined in the system or earlier in the file. For more information, see Variable substitution . Environment variable definitions files can be used for scenarios such as debugging and tool execution (including linters, formatters, IntelliSense, and testing tools), but are not applied to the terminal.  By default, the Python extension looks for and loads a file named .env in the current workspace folder, then applies those definitions. The file is identified by the default entry "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env" in your user settings (see General settings ). You can change the python.envFile setting at any time to use a different definitions file.  A debug configuration also contains an envFile property that also defaults to the .env file in the current workspace (see Debugging - Set configuration options ). This property allows you to easily set variables for debugging purposes that replace variables specified in the default .env file.  For example, when developing a web application, you might want to easily switch between development and production servers. Instead of coding the different URLs and other settings into your application directly, you could use separate definitions files for each. For example:  dev.env file  # dev.env - development configuration  # API endpoint  MYPROJECT_APIENDPOINT=https://my.domain.com/api/dev/  # Variables for the database  MYPROJECT_DBURL=https://my.domain.com/db/dev  MYPROJECT_DBUSER=devadmin  MYPROJECT_DBPASSWORD=!dfka**213=  prod.env file  # prod.env - production configuration  # API endpoint  MYPROJECT_APIENDPOINT=https://my.domain.com/api/  # Variables for the database  MYPROJECT_DBURL=https://my.domain.com/db/  MYPROJECT_DBUSER=coreuser  MYPROJECT_DBPASSWORD=kKKfa98*11@  You can then set the python.envFile setting to ${workspaceFolder}/prod.env , then set the envFile property in the debug configuration to ${workspaceFolder}/dev.env .   Note : When environment variables are specified using multiple methods, be aware that there is an order of precedence. Environment variables contained in the .env file specified by the python.envFile setting (user or workspace) will override variables defined in the envFile specified in launch.json , as well as any env variables defined in the launch.json file itself. Similarly, environment variables defined in the envFile specified in launch.json will override env variables defined in the launch.json file.   Variable substitution  When defining an environment variable in a definitions file, you can use the value of any existing environment variable with the following general syntax:  <VARIABLE>=... ${env : EXISTING_VARIABLE} ...  where ... means any other text as used in the value. The curly braces are required.  Within this syntax, the following rules apply:   Variables are processed in the order they appear in the .env file, so you can use any variable that's defined earlier in the file.  Single or double quotes don't affect substituted value and are included in the defined value. For example, if the value of VAR1 is abcedfg , then VAR2='${env:VAR1}' assigns the value 'abcedfg' to VAR2 .  The $ character can be escaped with a backslash, as in \$ .  You can use recursive substitution, such as PYTHONPATH=${env:PROJ_DIR}:${env:PYTHONPATH} (where PROJ_DIR is any other environment variable).  You can use only simple substitution; nesting such as ${_${env:VAR1}_EX} is not supported.  Entries with unsupported syntax are left as-is.   Use of the PYTHONPATH variable  The PYTHONPATH environment variable specifies additional locations where the Python interpreter should look for modules. In VS Code, PYTHONPATH can be set through the terminal settings (terminal.integrated.env.*) and/or within an .env file.  When the terminal settings are used, PYTHONPATH affects any tools that are run within the terminal by a user, as well as any action the extension performs for a user that is routed through the terminal such as debugging. However, in this case when the extension is performing an action that isn't routed through the terminal, such as the use of a linter or formatter, then this setting will not have an effect on module look-up.  When PYTHONPATH is set using an .env file, it will affect anything the extension does on your behalf and actions performed by the debugger, but it will not affect tools run in the terminal.  If needed, you can set PYTHONPATH using both methods.  An example of when to use PYTHONPATH would be if you have source code in a src folder and tests in a tests folder. When running tests, however, those tests can't normally access modules in src unless you hard-code relative paths.  To solve this problem, you could add the path to src to PYTHONPATH by creating an .env file within your VS Code workspace.  PYTHONPATH = src  Then set python.envFile in your settings.json file to point to the .env file you just created. For example, if the .env file was in your workspace root, your settings.json would be set as shown:  "python.envFile" : "${workspaceFolder}/.env"  The value of PYTHONPATH can contain multiple locations separated by os.pathsep : a semicolon ( ; ) on Windows and a colon ( : ) on Linux/macOS. Invalid paths are ignored. If you find that your value for PYTHONPATH isn't working as expected, make sure that you're using the correct separator between locations for the operating system. For example, using a colon to separate locations on Windows, or using a semicolon to separate locations on Linux/macOS results in an invalid value for PYTHONPATH, which is ignored.   Note : PYTHONPATH does not specify a path to a Python interpreter itself. For additional information about PYTHONPATH, read the PYTHONPATH documentation .

This page describes the key settings you can work with.  For general information about working with settings in VS Code, refer to User and workspace settings , as well as the Variables reference for information about predefined variable support.  General settings     Setting (python.)  Default  Description      condaPath  "conda"  Path to the conda executable.    defaultInterpreterPath  "python"  Path to the default Python interpreter to be used by the Python extension on the first time it loads for a workspace, or the path to a folder containing the Python interpreter. Can use variables like ${workspaceFolder} and ${workspaceFolder}/.venv . Using a path to a folder allows anyone working with a project to create an environment in the .venv folder as appropriate to their operating system, rather than having to specify an exact platform-dependent path. settings.json file can then be included in a source code repository. Note : Changes to this setting made after an interpreter has been selected for a workspace will not be applied or considered by the Python extension. As well, the Python extension doesn't automatically add or change this setting.    pipenvPath  "pipenv"  Path to the pipenv executable to use for activation.    disableInstallationCheck  false  If set to true , disables a warning from the extension if no Python interpreter is installed. On macOS, also disables a warning that appears if you're using the OS-installed Python interpreter. It's generally recommended to install a separate interpreter on macOS.    venvFolders  []  Paths to folders where virtual environments are created. Depending on the virtualization tool used, it can be the project itself: ${workspaceFolder} , or separate folders for all virtual environments located side by side: .\envs , ~/.virtualenvs , and so on.    envFile  "${workspaceFolder}/ .env"  Absolute path to a file containing environment variable definitions. See Configuring Python environments - environment variable definitions file .    globalModuleInstallation  false  Specifies whether to install packages for the current user only using the --user command-line argument (the default), or to install for all users in the global environment (when set to true ). Ignored when using a virtual environment. For more information on the --user argument, see pip - User Installs .    poetryPath  "poetry"  Specifies the location of the Poetry dependency manager executable, if installed. The default value "poetry" assumes the executable is in the current path. The Python extension uses this setting to install packages when Poetry is available and there's a poetry.lock file in the workspace folder.    terminal.launchArgs  []  Launch arguments that are given to the Python interpreter when you run a file using commands such as Python: Run Python File in Terminal . In the launchArgs list, each item is a top-level command-line element that's separated by a space (quoted values that contain spaces are a single top-level element and are thus one item in the list). For example, for the arguments --a --b --c {"value1" : 1, "value2" : 2} , the list items should be ["--a", "--b", "--c", "{\"value1\" : 1, \"value2\" : 2}\""] . Note that Visual Studio code ignores this setting when debugging because it instead uses arguments from your selected debugging configuration in launch.json .    terminal.executeInFileDir  false  Indicates whether to run a file in the file's directory instead of the current folder.    terminal.activateEnvironment  true  Indicates whether to automatically activate the environment you select using the Python: Select Interpreter command when a new terminal is created. For example, when this setting is true and you select a virtual environment, the extension automatically runs the environment's activate command when creating a new terminal ( source env/bin/activate on macOS/Linux; env\scripts\activate on Windows).    terminal.activateEnvInCurrentTerminal  false  Specifies whether to activate the currently open terminal when the Python extension is activated, using the virtual environment selected.    logging.level  error  Specifies the level of logging to be performed by the extension. The possible levels of logging, in increasing level of information provided, are off , error , warn , info , and debug . When set to off , which is not recommended, basic information will still be shown such as startup information and commands run by the Python extension. At the error level, basic information and errors will be shown. At the warn level, basic, error, and warning information will be shown. At the info level, basic, error, warning, and additional information like method execution times and return values will be shown. At this time, the debug level doesn't display additional information.     Code analysis settings  IntelliSense engine settings   Note: If you have never changed your language server setting, your language server is set to Pylance via the “Default” setting value.      Setting (python.)  Default  Description      languageServer  Default  Defines type of the language server (Default, Pylance , Jedi, and None).     Python Language Server settings  Pylance Language Server  The language server settings apply when python.languageServer is Pylance or Default . If you have difficulties with the language server, see Troubleshooting in the language server repository.     Setting (python.analysis.)  Default  Description      typeCheckingMode  off  Specifies the level of type checking analysis to perform. Available values are off , basic , and strict . When set to off no type checking analysis is conducted; unresolved imports/variables diagnostics are produced. When set to basic non-type checking-related rules (all rules in off ), as well as basic type checking rules are used. When set to strict all type checking rules at the highest severity of error (including all rules in off and basic categories) are used.    diagnosticMode  openFilesOnly  Specifies what code files the language server analyzes for problems. Available values are workspace and openFilesOnly .    stubPath  ./typings  Specifies a path to a directory that contains custom type stubs. Each package's type stub file(s) are expected to be in its own subdirectory.    autoSearchPaths  true  Indicates whether to automatically add search paths based on some predefined names (like src ). Available values are true and false .    extraPaths  []  Specifies extra search paths for import resolution. Paths should be specified as strings and must be separated by commas when there are multiple paths. ["path 1","path 2"]    completeFunctionParens  false  Adds parentheses to function completions. Accepted values are true and false .    useLibraryCodeForTypes  true  Parses the source code for a package when a type stub is not found. Available values are true and false .    autoImportCompletions  true  Controls the offering of auto-imports in completions. Available values are true and false .    diagnosticSeverityOverrides  {}  Allows a user to override the severity levels for individual diagnostics. For each rule, the available severity levels are error (red squiggle), warning (yellow squiggle), information (blue squiggle), and none (rule disabled). For information about the keys to use for the diagnostic severity rules, see the Diagnostic severity rules section below.      Note: Similar to the core Python extension, Pylance has an Insiders program that offers early access to new features and improvements. To enable the Insiders program, set pylance.insidersChannel to daily . This setting enables a daily check for new builds. At startup or when the Insiders setting is changed, Pylance will automatically update and prompt you to reload. To leave the Insiders program, just remove the setting, or explicitly set it to off instead. You might be prompted to downgrade your extension to the latest stable version.   Diagnostic severity rules  This section details all the available rules that can be customized using the python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides setting as shown in the following example.  {   "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides" : {   "reportUnboundVariable" : "information" ,   "reportImplicitStringConcatenation" : "warning"  }  }     Value  Description      reportGeneralTypeIssues  Diagnostics for general type inconsistencies, unsupported operations, argument/parameter mismatches, etc. This covers all of the basic type-checking rules not covered by other rules. It does not include syntax errors.    reportPropertyTypeMismatch  Diagnostics for properties where the type of the value passed to the setter is not assignable to the value returned by the getter. Such mismatches violate the intended use of properties, which are meant to act like variables.    reportPropertyTypeMismatch  Diagnostics for member accesses on functions.    reportMissingImports  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding imported python file or type stub file.    reportMissingModuleSource  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding source file. This happens when a type stub is found, but the module source file was not found, indicating that the code may fail at runtime when using this execution environment. Type checking will be done using the type stub.    reportMissingTypeStubs  Diagnostics for imports that have no corresponding type stub file (either a typeshed file or a custom type stub). The type checker requires type stubs to do its best job at analysis.    reportImportCycles  Diagnostics for cyclical import chains. These are not errors in Python, but they do slow down type analysis and often hint at architectural layering issues. Generally, they should be avoided.    reportUnusedImport  Diagnostics for an imported symbol that is not referenced within that file.    reportUnusedClass  Diagnostics for a class with a private name (starting with an underscore) that is not accessed.    reportUnusedFunction  Diagnostics for a function or method with a private name (starting with an underscore) that is not accessed.    reportUnusedVariable  Diagnostics for a variable that is not accessed.    reportDuplicateImport  Diagnostics for an imported symbol or module that is imported more than once.    reportWildcardImportFromLibrary  Diagnostics for a wildcard import from an external library.    reportOptionalSubscript  Diagnostics for an attempt to subscript (index) a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalMemberAccess  Diagnostics for an attempt to access a member of a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalCall  Diagnostics for an attempt to call a variable with an Optional type.    reportOptionalIterable  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as an iterable value (e.g. within a for statement).    reportOptionalContextManager  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as a context manager (as a parameter to a with statement).    reportOptionalOperand  Diagnostics for an attempt to use an Optional type as an operand to a binary or unary operator (like '+', '==', 'or', 'not').    reportUntypedFunctionDecorator  Diagnostics for function decorators that have no type annotations. These obscure the function type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedClassDecorator  Diagnostics for class decorators that have no type annotations. These obscure the class type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedBaseClass  Diagnostics for base classes whose type cannot be determined statically. These obscure the class type, defeating many type analysis features.    reportUntypedNamedTuple  Diagnostics when “namedtuple” is used rather than “NamedTuple”. The former contains no type information, whereas the latter does.    reportPrivateUsage  Diagnostics for incorrect usage of private or protected variables or functions. Protected class members begin with a single underscore _ and can be accessed only by subclasses. Private class members begin with a double underscore but do not end in a double underscore and can be accessed only within the declaring class. Variables and functions declared outside of a class are considered private if their names start with either a single or double underscore, and they cannot be accessed outside of the declaring module.    reportConstantRedefinition  Diagnostics for attempts to redefine variables whose names are all-caps with underscores and numerals.    reportIncompatibleMethodOverride  Diagnostics for methods that override a method of the same name in a base class in an incompatible manner (wrong number of parameters, incompatible parameter types, or incompatible return type).    reportIncompatibleVariableOverride  Diagnostics for class variable declarations that override a symbol of the same name in a base class with a type that is incompatible with the base class symbol type.    reportInvalidStringEscapeSequence  Diagnostics for invalid escape sequences used within string literals. The Python specification indicates that such sequences will generate a syntax error in future versions.    reportUnknownParameterType  Diagnostics for input or return parameters for functions or methods that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownArgumentType  Diagnostics for call arguments for functions or methods that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownLambdaType  Diagnostics for input or return parameters for lambdas that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownVariableType  Diagnostics for variables that have an unknown type.    reportUnknownMemberType  Diagnostics for class or instance variables that have an unknown type.    reportMissingTypeArgument  Diagnostics for when a generic class is used without providing explicit or implicit type arguments.    reportInvalidTypeVarUse  Diagnostics for improper use of type variables in a function signature.    reportCallInDefaultInitializer  Diagnostics for function calls within a default value initialization expression. Such calls can mask expensive operations that are performed at module initialization time.    reportUnnecessaryIsInstance  Diagnostics for 'isinstance' or 'issubclass' calls where the result is statically determined to be always true or always false. Such calls are often indicative of a programming error.    reportUnnecessaryCast  Diagnostics for 'cast' calls that are statically determined to be unnecessary. Such calls are sometimes indicative of a programming error.    reportAssertAlwaysTrue  Diagnostics for 'assert' statement that will probably always assert. This can be indicative of a programming error.    reportSelfClsParameterName  Diagnostics for a missing or misnamed “self” parameter in instance methods and “cls” parameter in class methods. Instance methods in metaclasses (classes that derive from “type”) are allowed to use “cls” for instance methods.    reportImplicitStringConcatenation  Diagnostics for two or more string literals that follow each other, indicating an implicit concatenation. This is considered a bad practice and often masks bugs such as missing commas.    reportUndefinedVariable  Diagnostics for undefined variables.    reportUnboundVariable  Diagnostics for unbound and possibly unbound variables.    reportInvalidStubStatement  Diagnostics for statements that should not appear within a stub file.    reportUnusedCallResult  Diagnostics for call expressions whose results are not consumed and are not None.    reportUnsupportedDunderAll  Diagnostics for unsupported operations performed on __all__ .    reportUnusedCoroutine  Diagnostics for call expressions that return a Coroutine and whose results are not consumed.     Jedi Language Server  The language server settings apply when python.languageServer is Jedi .     Setting  Default  Description      jediPath  ""  Path to folder containing the Jedi library (folder should contain a jedi subfolder).    jediMemoryLimit  0  Memory limit for the Jedi completion engine in megabytes. Zero (the default) means 1024 MB. -1 disables the memory limit check.     AutoComplete settings     Setting (python.autoComplete.)  Default  Description  See also      extraPaths  []  Specifies locations of additional packages for which to load autocomplete data.  Editing     Formatting settings     Setting (python.formatting.)  Default  Description  See also      provider  "autopep8"  Specifies the formatter to use, either "autopep8", "black", or "yapf".  Editing - Formatting    autopep8Path  "autopep8"  Path to autopep8  Editing - Formatting    autopep8Args  []  Arguments for autopep8, where each top-level element that's separated by a space is a separate item in the list.  Editing - Formatting    blackPath  "black"  Path to black  Editing - Formatting    blackArgs  []  Arguments for black, where each top-level element that's separated by a space is a separate item in the list.  Editing - Formatting    yapfPath  "yapf"  Path to yapf  Editing - Formatting    yapfArgs  []  Arguments for yapf, where each top-level element that's separated by a space is a separate item in the list.  Editing - Formatting     Refactoring - Sort Imports settings     Setting (python.sortImports.)

Similar to the general VS Code settings, variables use the ${variableName} syntax. Specifically, the extension supports the following variables:    ${cwd} - the task runner's current working directory on startup    ${workspaceFolder} - the path of the folder opened in VS Code    ${workspaceRootFolderName} - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)    ${workspaceFolderBasename} - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)    ${file} - the current opened file    ${relativeFile} - the current opened file relative to workspaceFolder    ${relativeFileDirname} - the current opened file's dirname relative to workspaceFolder    ${fileBasename} - the current opened file's basename    ${fileBasenameNoExtension} - the current opened file's basename with no file extension    ${fileDirname} - the current opened file's dirname    ${fileExtname} - the current opened file's extension    ${lineNumber} - the current selected line number in the active file    ${selectedText} - the current selected text in the active file    ${execPath} - the path to the running VS Code executable    For additional information about predefined variables and example usages, see the Variables reference in the general VS Code docs.

It should be something like this:  {
  "python.pythonPath": "C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe"
}  Next time you use vscode to open this folder, the python interpreter you used last time should be automatically selected.  Maybe you didn't use "Open folder" to open the working directory. And then vscode will try to read the local .vscode folder if any, otherwise it will follow a certain path order to select an interpreter. Hope that helps.

In your case, you wish to set it to /usr/bin/python3.6 . Though I would suggest using a virtual environment .  {  
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/usr/bin/python3.6"
}  If you are using virtual environment, to ensure that the terminal is using the associated python environment , check the second option Python > Terminal: Activate Environment :   In settings.json it is called "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true .  One reason your change did not persist, was because in your screenshot, you opened your workspace's  settings.json .
To make it default, you should edit your user's  settings.json instead.
This you can access with Ctrl+Shift+P , Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) .

It does not work. Whatever the answer is, it is not 'Python: Select Interpreter'. I have Python 3.8 selected. But code chooses version 3.7.2.  I have rebooted.  It still chooses 3.7.2 .  So whatever solution does this it is not simply using the command pallet. I can find the right version by copying what Code says and running it on the command line.  But Code, does not run that command that it says it is supposed to.  – RichMeister   Sep 11, 2020 at 22:58            |  Show 4 more comments                  19               UPD . First, read the update #1 part in the bottom  (Try update#1 first) Looking at your screenshots I see you are using Code Runner extension. And I guess that is the way you are launching your programs.
I don't know how it works internally, but adding this line into Code-Runner extension setting.json file fixed it:  "code-runner.executorMap.python": {...
"python": "python3 -u",
...}  Found it in Code-Runner GitHub repository: https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner/issues/366  If you type "python --help", you'll see "-u" flag stands for "unbuffered binary stdout and stderr..." - don't know why it matters here.  Update #1 . This became not so convenient further - I started using python's virual environments and the solution above couldn't launch these environments, cause python3 (symlink) is always linking to the same python environment.  The solution here is to use Code-Runner's supported customized parameters, so you should change "python" line in it's settings.json to:  ...
"python": "$pythonPath $fullFileName",

File -> Preferences -> Settings  Type in "python.pythonPath" in the search bar.  Change it to what you normally run python with from the command line. If you have your Path environment variable set, that's just python . If not, it's likely the full path to the executable.

This path can be set under CTRL+SHIFT+P Python: Select Interpreter.     Path that is used when you type "python" in the terminal, and this is in "Environment Variables" in Windows 10 (Similar locations under Linux and Mac). In Windows 10 you can choose to have several Python versions, usually under C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##. Just make sure you change Environment variables C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python## and C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##\Scripts accordingly. This will also affect which pip you use, i.e. a pip that belongs to Python 3.8, or a pip that belongs to Python 3.9. Terminal in VSCode in general pertains to your default terminal I think. So in Windows 10 when you type "python" in CMD Line, it should be the same version as VSCode terminal.   For sanity purposes you should make sure that both "Python: Select Interpreter" and the system environment variables point to the same version of Python.  Bonus goodie in Windows 10. If you don't have environment variable setup, and you type 'python' in VSCode terminal, it'll point to C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe, which just opens up python link in Windows AppStore 🙄.

I found two relevant settings from an issue in Feb 2021 .
Checking the second option Python > Terminal: Activate Environment enables automatic activation of virtual environment:   In settings.json it is called "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true .  Update (8 Aug 2021):
Today when I opened the terminal from VS Code on Windows, it automatically inserted a line of code & C:/Users/[UserName]/[venv]/Scripts/Activate.ps1 to activate the appropriate environment associated with the selected python interpreter!
It appears the aforementioned settings is now the default behavior.
While there are changes to Terminal behavior in the release notes of July 2021 (version 1.59) , I don't see virtual environment activation being explicitly mentioned.  The new behavior is documented here, in " Environments and Terminal windows ".   "python.pythonPath"  has been deprecated  Therefore most previous answers are outdated.
Use "python.defaultInterpreterPath" instead:   2021.6.0 (16 June 2021) 5. Added python.defaultInterpreterPath setting at workspace level when in pythonDeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#16485) 8. Show python.pythonPath deprecation prompt when in pythonDeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#16485)    2020.7.0 (16 July 2020) 9.

Do a one-off transfer of existing values for python.pythonPath setting to new Interpreter storage if in DeprecatePythonPath experiment. (#11052) 8. Added prompt asking users to delete python.pythonPath key from their workspace settings when in Deprecate PythonPath experiment. (#11108) 12. Rename string ${config:python.pythonPath} which is used in launch.json to refer to interpreter path set in settings, to ${config:python.interpreterPath}. (#11446)    2020.4.0 (20 April 2020) 13. Added a user setting python.defaultInterpreterPath to set up the default interpreter path when in Deprecate PythonPath experiment. (#11021)   If you wish to set a default python interpreter for all workspaces, open settings with Ctrl+Shift+P , Preferences: Open User Settings and search for Python: Default Interpreter Path . Otherwise, if you want to set it for only the current workspace, use Preferences: Open Workspace Settings instead.   In your case, you wish to set it to ${workspaceFolder}/env/bin/python3.6 .
If you edit settings.json directly instead of using the GUI:  {  
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/env/bin/python3.6"
}  Detailed instructions can be found in the documentation "Manually specify an interpreter" , including using environment variables as the interpreter's path.

Bottom Screen Navigation (ease of access)   This is my quickest approach, however, it isn't always available for first-time users. If you're already using Python in VS Code, this is usually the simplest way to reach the Python: Select Interpreter menu. On the bottom left of your screen, look for "Python X.X.X ". This is the currently detected/configured version of Python in your project, and clicking it brings you to the interpreter menu to change the Python version you're using. At the time of writing, I was using Python 3.9.1 in the snippet below:    Command Palette   As @jmh denoted in his answer, you can also use the 'View' tab to navigate to the Command Palette . In the Command Palette, search for Python: Select Interpreter to then bring about the same menu denoted above.  Happy coding!

The input() function would not convert the input to a string and that's when I realized what was happening.  Typing Python in the terminal window showed 2.7 was running.  For me....  Even though "python.pythonPath" was pointing to a seemingly correct location (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64), one of my environment variables was pointing to C:\Users\Mike.windows-build-tools\python27.  I deleted the environment variable and reinstalled Python 3.8 from the Microsoft Store and it immediately installed.  I got a message from VS Code (it was running) that 3.8 got installed.  I clicked Terminal/New Terminal, typed Python and it showed version 3.8.  Typed 'Python xxx.py' and the code started working as it had been.

I have tried many different things like selecting interpreter option in the left bottom corner, and settings like "python.PythonPath":"C:\\Users\\Nithin K Joy\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe","python.disableInstallationCheck":false, "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true, "python.venvPath":"C:\\Users\\Nithin K Joy\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe", whatever I do it still runs on conda environment. The only thing that worked is removing conda path from system env and running vs code. But that is not a ideal way to deal. Anyone please help. Thanks in advance.      python  python-3.x  visual-studio-code  anaconda  vscode-settings           Share    Improve this question    Follow         asked Aug 29, 2020 at 8:31       Nithin K Joy Nithin K Joy   768 4 4 silver badges 12 12 bronze badges         3            For me, "Python" extension saves the last selected interpreter and default settings.

Restart the vscode to make the setting work.  Since python.pythonPath setting is being removed from all 3 scopes - User, workspace, workspace folder, more information you can refer to vscode-python-DeprecatePythonPath .

Make sure that you put it in User settings. then close the vscode and open a clean folder, create a .py file and you'll find the environment is activated and the interpreter is the one you selected before.  – Molly Wang-MSFT   Aug 31, 2020 at 10:04            I think its problem with my VScode version is 1.4.1. Anyway I uninstalled Anaconda, its a headache for me, and now I am using jupyter notebook in vs code by using Microsoft python extension.

But as I am using VSC Remote connected via SSH to a remote machine, VSC doesn't accept any defaultInterpreterPath config. I am stuck to VSC version 1l50.1 currently.  – fmfreeze   Nov 26, 2021 at 11:04            |  Show 4 more comments               Your Answer                  Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!

I tried the following code:  import sys
print(sys.version)  When I run the file, some reason, it shows:  3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.2.0 (32-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 11:45:57) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]  I've tried the following:
  At the very bottom of VSCode, I clicked on the Python version, then clicked on "Python 3.7.3 64-bit", but when I reran the code, it still shows "3.5.2 |Anaconda..."  I also tried checking the settings, and it's showing:  Python: Python Path
    C:\Users\[MY_USE_NAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe  I also tried just typing "python" in the command like, and it still says "Python 3.5.2".  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

It will show you available interpreters (virtual environments + the global environment) to choose.  If you want to change version of python you are using , you must first create a virtual environment with desired version of python and then choose it as your interpreter. (I recommend to create it in .venv directory in the root directory of your project)  This answer will help you with that.

Or you also can do Python: Run Selection/Line in Python terminal on some non empty line of the source code to open the python shell, but it is hacky. The problem is that when you open the intergrated terminal it still uses PATH variable to find python executable.  – ThatAnnoyingDude   Oct 20, 2019 at 7:52               Thanks.  Updating the Path worked.  But is my setup not working correctly?  I would have thought that selecting the environment in VSCode would make that the default.  I thought that selector on the bottom left corner of VS code was there so that I could switch back and forth easier. Or am I not understanding correctly?  – NL3294   Oct 20, 2019 at 17:32        1      It is for changing the path for python that Python extension will use to run/debug your scripts and provide intellisense. It doesn't affect the intergrated terminal though.  – ThatAnnoyingDude   Oct 20, 2019 at 18:55        1      @ThatAnnoyingDude, your last comment is not true anymore.

An environment consists of an interpreter, a library (typically the Python Standard Library), and a set of installed packages. These components together determine valid language constructs and syntax, operating-system functionality that you can access, and packages you can use.  In Visual Studio on Windows, you use the Python Environments window, as described in this article, to manage environments and select one as the default for new projects. Other aspects of environments are found in the following articles:   For any given project, you can select a specific environment rather than use the default.   For details on creating and using virtual environments for Python projects, see Use virtual environments .   If you want to install packages in an environment, refer to the Packages tab reference .   To install another Python interpreter, see Install Python interpreters . In general, if you download and run an installer for a mainline Python distribution, Visual Studio detects that new installation and the environment appears in the Python Environments window and can be selected for projects.    If you're new to Python in Visual Studio, the following articles also provide from general background:   Work with Python in Visual Studio  Install Python support in Visual Studio     Note  You can't manage environments for Python code that is opened only as a folder using the File > Open > Folder command. Instead, Create a Python project from existing code to enjoy the environment features of Visual Studio.      Note  You can manage environments for Python code that is opened as a folder using the File > Open > Folder command. The Python toolbar allows you switch between all detected environments, and also add a new environment. The environment information is stored in the PythonSettings.json file in the Workspace .vs folder.    The Python Environments window  The environments that Visual Studio knows about are displayed in the Python Environments window. To open the window, use one of the following methods:   Select the View > Other Windows > Python Environments menu command.  Right-click the Python Environments node for a project in Solution Explorer and select View All Python Environments :            In all these cases, the Python Environments window appears alongside Solution Explorer :           Visual Studio looks for installed global environments using the registry (following PEP 514 ), along with virtual environments and conda environments (see Types of environments ). If you don't see an expected environment in the list, see Manually identify an existing environment .  When you select an environment in the list, Visual Studio displays various properties and commands for that environment on the Overview tab.   For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Python36-32 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2017- Overview .    For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Python36-32 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2019- Overview .    For example, you can see in the image above that the interpreter's location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Python310 . The four commands at the bottom of the Overview tab each open a command prompt with the interpreter running. For more information, see Python Environments window tab reference 2022- Overview .   Use the drop-down list below the list of environments to switch to different tabs such as Packages , and IntelliSense . These tabs are also described in the Python Environments window tab reference .  Selecting an environment doesn't change its relation to any projects. The default environment, shown in boldface in the list, is the one that Visual Studio uses for any new projects. To use a different environment with new projects, use the Make this the default environment for new projects command. Within the context of a project, you can always select a specific environment. For more information, see Select an environment for a project .  To the right of each listed environment, is a control that opens an Interactive window for that environment. (In Visual Studio 2017 15.5 and earlier, another control appears that refreshes the IntelliSense database for that environment. See Environments window tab reference for details about the database.)    Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.      Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.      Tip  When you expand the Python Environments window wide enough, you'll get a fuller view of your environments that is more convenient to work with.     Note  Although Visual Studio respects the system-site-packages option, it doesn't provide a way to change it from within Visual Studio.   What if no environments appear?  If no environments appear, it means Visual Studio failed to detect any Python installations in standard locations. For example, you might have installed Visual Studio 2017 or later but cleared all the interpreter options in the installer options for the Python workload. Similarly, you might have installed Visual Studio 2015 or earlier but didn't install an interpreter manually (see Install Python interpreters ).  If you know you have a Python interpreter on your computer but Visual Studio (any version) didn't detect it, then use the + Custom command to specify its location manually. See the next section, Manually identify an existing environment .    Tip  Visual Studio detects updates to an existing interpreter, such as upgrading Python 2.7.11 to 2.7.14 using the installers from python.org. During the installation process, the older environment disappears from the Python Environments list before the update appears in its place.    However, if you manually move an interpreter and its environment using the file system, Visual Studio won't know the new location. For more information, see Move an interpreter .    Types of environments  Visual Studio can work with global, virtual, and conda environments.  Global environments  Each Python installation maintains its own global environment . For example, Python 2.7, Python 3.6, Python 3.7, Anaconda 4.4.0, and so on. See Install Python interpreters )  Each environment is composed of the specific Python interpreter, its standard library, a set of pre-installed packages, and any other packages you install while that environment is activated. Installing a package into a global environment makes it available to all projects using that environment. If the environment is located in a protected area of the file system (within c:\program files , for example), then installing packages requires administrator privileges.  Global environments are available to all projects on the computer. In Visual Studio, you select one global environment as the default, which is used for all projects unless you specifically choose a different one for a project. For more information, see Select an environment for a project .  Virtual environments  Working in a global environment is an easy way to get started. Over time, the environments become cluttered with many different packages that you've installed for different projects. Such clutter makes it difficult to thoroughly test your application against a specific set of packages with known versions. But,  the kind of environment is exactly as above that you'd set up on a build server or web server. Conflicts can also occur when two projects require incompatible packages or different versions of the same package.  For this reason, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. If you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you then run a Python program within that environment, you know that it's running against only those specific packages.  Visual Studio provides direct support for creating a virtual environment for a project. For example, if you open a project that contains a requirements.txt , or create a project from a template that includes that file, Visual Studio prompts you automatically to create a virtual environment and install those dependencies.  At any time within an open project, you can create a new virtual environment. In Solution Explorer , expand the project node, right-click Python Environments , and choose Add environment . In Add Environment , choose Virtual environment .   For more information, see Create a virtual environment-2019 .    For more information, see Create a virtual environment-2022 .   Visual Studio also provides a command to generate a requirements.txt file from a virtual environment, making it easy to recreate the environment on other computers. For more information, see Use virtual environments .  Conda environments  A conda environment is one you create using the conda tool, or with integrated conda management in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and higher. (Requires Anaconda or Miniconda, which are available through the Visual Studio installer, see Install Visual Studio 2017    Select + Create conda environment in the Python Environments window, which opens a Create new conda environment tab:    Enter a name for the environment in the Name field, select a base Python interpreter in the Python field, and select Create .   The Output window shows progress for the new environment, with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Conda environment tab:    Configure the following fields:     Field  Description      Project  The project in which to create the environment (if you have multiple projects in the same Visual Studio solution).    Name  The name for the conda environment.    Add packages from  Choose Environment file if you have an environment.yml file describing your dependencies, or choose One or more Anaconda package names and list at least one Python package or a Python version in the field below. The package list instructs conda to create a Python environment. To install the latest version of Python, use python ; to install a specific version, use python=,major>.<minor> as in python=3.7 . You can also use the package button to select Python versions and common packages from a series of menus.    Set as current environment  Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created.    Set as default environment for new projects  Automatically sets and activates the conda environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. This option is the same as using the Make this the default environment for new projects in the Python Environments window.    View in Python Environments window  Specifies whether to show the Python Environments window after creating the environment.      Important  When creating a conda environment, be sure to specify at least one Python version or Python package using either environments.yml or the package list, which ensures that the environment contains a Python runtime. Otherwise, Visual Studio ignores the environment: the environment doesn't appear anywhere the Python Environments window, isn't be set as the current environment for a project, and isn't available as a global environment.  If you happen to create a conda environment without a Python version, use the conda info command to see the locations of conda environment folders, then manually remove the subfolder for the environment from that location.    Select Create , and observe progress in the Output window.    The output includes with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install more packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Conda environment tab:    Configure the following fields:     Field  Description      Project  The project in which to create the environment (if you have multiple projects in the same Visual Studio solution).    Name  The name for the conda environment.    Add packages from  Choose Environment file if you have an environment.yml file describing your dependencies, or choose One or more Anaconda package names and list at least one Python package or a Python version in the field below. The package list instructs conda to create a Python environment. To install the latest version of Python, use python ; to install a specific version, use python=,major>.<minor> as in python=3.7 . You can also use the package button to select Python versions and common packages from a series of menus.    Set as current environment  Activates the new environment in the selected project after the environment is created.    Set as default environment for new projects  Automatically sets and activates the conda environment in any new projects created in Visual Studio. This option is the same as using the Make this the default environment for new projects in the Python Environments window.    View in Python Environments window  Specifies whether to show the Python Environments window after creating the environment.      Important  When creating a conda environment, be sure to specify at least one Python version or Python package using either environments.yml or the package list, which ensures that the environment contains a Python runtime. Otherwise, Visual Studio ignores the environment: the environment doesn't appear anywhere the Python Environments window, isn't be set as the current environment for a project, and isn't available as a global environment.  If you happen to create a conda environment without a Python version, use the conda info command to see the locations of conda environment folders, then manually remove the subfolder for the environment from that location.    Select Create , and observe progress in the Output window. The output includes with a few CLI instructions once creation is complete:    Within Visual Studio, you can activate a conda environment for a project as you would any other environment as described on Select an environment for a project .   To install more packages in the environment, use the Packages tab .      Note  For best results with conda environments, use conda 4.4.8 or later (conda versions are different from Anaconda versions). You can install suitable versions of Miniconda (Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2022) and Anaconda (Visual Studio 2017) through the Visual Studio installer.   To see the conda version, where conda environments are stored, and other information, run conda info at an Anaconda command prompt (that is, a command prompt where Anaconda is in the path):  conda info  Your conda environment folders appear as follows:  envs directories : C:\Users\user\.conda\envs
                          c:\anaconda3\envs
                          C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\conda\conda\envs  Because conda environments aren't stored with a project, they act similarly to global environments. For example, installing a new package into a conda environment makes that package available to all projects using that environment.  For Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 and earlier, you can use conda environments by pointing to them manually as described under Manually identify an existing environment .  Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 and later detects conda environments automatically and displays them in the Python Environments window as described in the next section.  Manually identify an existing environment  Use the following steps to identify an environment that's installed in a non-standard location:   Use the following steps to identify an environment that's installed in a non-standard location (including conda environments in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 and earlier):   Select + Custom in the Python Environments window, which opens the Configure tab:    Enter a name for the environment in the Description field.   Enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter in the Prefix path field.   If Visual Studio detects a Python interpreter at that location (such as the path shown below for a conda environment), it enables the Auto Detect command. Selecting Auto Detect completes the remaining fields. You can also complete those fields manually.     Once the fields contain the values you want, select Apply to save the configuration. You can now use the environment like any other within Visual Studio.   If you need to remove a manually identified environment, select the Remove command on the Configure tab. Autodetected environments don't provide this option. For more information, see Configure tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Existing environment tab:    Select the Environment drop-down, then select Custom :    In the provided fields in the dialog box, enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter under Prefix path , which fills in most of the other fields.   After reviewing those values and modifying as necessary, select Add .     You can also review and modify details of the environment at any time in the Python Environments window.   In Python environment window, select the environment, and then select the Configure tab.   After making changes, select the Apply command.
You can also remove the environment using the Remove command (not available for autodetected environments). For more information, see Configure tab .       Select Add Environment... in the Python Environments window (or from the Python toolbar), which opens the Add environment dialog box.   In the Add environment dialog, select the Existing environment tab:   For example, select an existing environment and the path to the existing environment.   Select the Environment drop-down, then select Custom :  .  For example, Anaconda 2021.05 in C:\Users\user\Anaconda3\python.exe   In the provided fields in the dialog box, enter or browse (using ... ) to the path of the interpreter under Prefix path , which fills in most of the other fields.   After reviewing those values and modifying as necessary, select Add .    You can also review and modify details of the environment at any time in the Python Environments window.   In the Python environment window, select the environment, and then select the Configure tab.   After making changes, select the Apply command.
You can also remove the environment using the Remove command (not available for autodetected environments). For more information, see Configure tab .     Fix or delete invalid environments  If Visual Studio finds registry entries for an environment, but the path to the interpreter is invalid, then the Python Environments window shows the name with a strikeout font:        To correct an environment you wish to keep, first try using its installer's Repair process. The installers for standard Python 3.x, for example, include that option.  Modify the registry to correct an environment that doesn't have a repair option, or to remove an invalid environment  Use the following steps to modify the registry directly. Visual Studio automatically updates the Python Environments window when you make changes to the registry.   Run regedit.exe .   Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python . For IronPython, look for IronPython instead.   Expand the node that matches the distribution, such as Python Core for CPython or ContinuumAnalytics for Anaconda. For IronPython, expand the version number node.   Inspect the values under the InstallPath node:    If the environment still exists on your computer, change the value of ExecutablePath to the correct location. Also correct the (Default) and WindowedExecutablePath values as necessary.  If the environment no longer exists on your computer and you want to remove it from the Python Environments window, delete the parent node of InstallPath , such as 3.6 in the image above.  Invalid settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Python override the settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python     See also   Install Python interpreters  Select an interpreter for a project  Use requirements.txt for dependencies  Search paths  Python Environments window reference           Feedback   Submit and view feedback for    This product     This page        View all page feedback                      Theme                     Light                    Dark                    High contrast           Previous Version Docs  Blog  Contribute  Privacy & Cookies  Terms of Use  Trademarks  © Microsoft 2022         In this article                              Theme                     Light                    Dark                    High contrast           Previous Version Docs  Blog  Contribute  Privacy & Cookies  Terms of Use  Trademarks  © Microsoft 2022      20HTTP Error 403: Forbidden21   Google Help Sign in Google Help Help Center Google Privacy Policy Terms of Service Submit feedback  Send feedback on...
